    {Mammary gland structure and breast cancer progression}
    {Breast cancer originates from the bilayer epithelial cells lining the branched system of the mammary gland, often specifically within the milk-producing \acf{TDLU}. Initially, these cancer cells divide and fill the lumen of the ducts and lobules, a phase termed carcinoma in situ. Subsequently, these cells may penetrate the basement membrane, invading adjacent tissues in a stage called invasive carcinoma. Eventually, the cancer cells gain the potential to enter the bloodstream and metastasise to distant body sites.}

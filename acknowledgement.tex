\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I could not have accomplished the work presented in this thesis without the exceptionally collaborative, intellectually stimulating, and supportive environment I have been privileged to experience throughout my PhD journey. First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors and ``scientific parents" \acl{moritz} and \acl{lucy}. Your balanced mentorship -- allowing autonomy while offering guidance -- has been invaluable. I also thank the Gerstung group for their \textit{esprit de corps} and engaging lunch and coffee-break conversations. I thank my collaborators Artem and Gleb from Dissatisfaction.ai team, and Mikhail S. Batov. Our side projects offered a much-needed break from the primary research. I must also thank Vitalii for our stimulating dialogues on mathematical models, biology and life. 

I appreciate the sense of community and social engagement within the EBI predoc group. This has created a relaxed social atmosphere which made my PhD time much more enjoyable. I would also like to thank the EBI cycling club members -- Lukas, Leah, Paula, and Felix -- for the enjoyable rides and slipstreams during our commutes.

Finally, my deepest gratitude goes to Paula for her unwavering love and support, and to my family for staying close despite being so far away.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene expression analysis of breast cancer largely
              relies on homogenized tissue samples. Due to the high degree of
              cellular and molecular heterogeneity of tumor tissues, bulk
              tissue-based analytical approaches can only provide very limited
              system-level information about different signaling mechanisms and
              cellular interactions within the complex tissue context. METHODS:
              We describe an analytical approach using in situ sequencing
              (ISS), enabling highly multiplexed, spatially and morphologically
              resolved gene expression profiling. Ninety-one genes including
              prognostic and predictive marker profiles, as well as genes
              involved in specific cellular pathways were mapped within whole
              breast cancer tissue sections, covering luminal A/B-like,
              HER2-positive and triple negative tumors. Finally, all these
              features were combined and assembled into a
              molecular-morphological OncoMap for each tumor tissue. FINDINGS:
              Our in situ approach spatially revealed intratumoral
              heterogeneity with regard to tumor subtype as well as to the
              OncotypeDX recurrence score and even uncovered areas of minor
              cellular subpopulations. Since ISS-resolved molecular profiles
              are linked to their histological context, a deeper analysis of
              the core and periphery of tumor foci enabled identification of
              specific gene expression patterns associated with these
              morphologically relevant regions. INTERPRETATION: ISS generated
              OncoMaps represent useful tools to extend our general
              understanding of the biological processes behind tumor
              progression and can further support the identification of novel
              therapeutical targets as well as refine tumor diagnostics. FUND:

  abstract      = "ABSTRACTOne of the core problems of modern statistics is to
                   approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This
                   problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics,
                   which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a
                   calculation involving the posterior density. In this
                   article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from
                   machine learning that approximates probability densities
                   through optimization. VI has been used in many applications
                   and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as
                   Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to
                   first posit a family of densities and then to find a member
                   of that family which is close to the target density.
                   Closeness is measured by Kullback?Leibler divergence. We
                   review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference,
                   discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family
                   models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of
                   Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic

                   research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is

              variability within the original clone allowing sequential

              apparently more genetically unstable than normal cells, perhaps
              from activation of specific gene loci in the neoplasm, continued
              presence of carcinogen, or even nutritional deficiencies within

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer
              (NSCLC), data on intratumor heterogeneity and cancer genome
              evolution have been limited to small retrospective cohorts. We
              wanted to prospectively investigate intratumor heterogeneity in
              relation to clinical outcome and to determine the clonal nature
              of driver events and evolutionary processes in early-stage NSCLC.
              METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we performed
              multiregion whole-exome sequencing on 100 early-stage NSCLC
              tumors that had been resected before systemic therapy. We
              sequenced and analyzed 327 tumor regions to define evolutionary
              histories, obtain a census of clonal and subclonal events, and
              assess the relationship between intratumor heterogeneity and
              recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: We observed widespread
              intratumor heterogeneity for both somatic copy-number alterations
              and mutations. Driver mutations in EGFR, MET, BRAF, and TP53 were
              almost always clonal. However, heterogeneous driver alterations
              that occurred later in evolution were found in more than 75\% of
              the tumors and were common in PIK3CA and NF1 and in genes that
              are involved in chromatin modification and DNA damage response
              and repair. Genome doubling and ongoing dynamic chromosomal
              instability were associated with intratumor heterogeneity and
              resulted in parallel evolution of driver somatic copy-number
              alterations, including amplifications in CDK4, FOXA1, and BCL11A.
              Elevated copy-number heterogeneity was associated with an
              increased risk of recurrence or death (hazard ratio, 4.9;
              P=4.4$\times$10-4), which remained significant in multivariate
              analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Intratumor heterogeneity mediated through
              chromosome instability was associated with an increased risk of
              recurrence or death, a finding that supports the potential value
              of chromosome instability as a prognostic predictor. (Funded by

               tumors have been recognized by pathologists for many years.
               Indeed, Virchow's original conception of a malignant tumor was
               one composed of cells, derived from the tissue cells of the
               individual, but differing from the normal cells in the rapidity
               and independence of their growth.Hansemann (1) carried this idea
               somewhat further and introduced the word ``anaplasia'' to
               indicate the process by which cancer cells came to differ from
               the normal type cell of the body tissue concerned. Anaplasia
               involves a loss of differentiation and an increase of
               reproductive power, so that the anaplastic cell fulfils only in
               abortive fashion, if at all, its normal function, such as
               secretion or keratinization; while it shows by increased number
               of mitotic figures, and especially by the irregularity and
               abnormality of its nuclear chromatic elements and figures, the
               increase in rapidity of cell division and of cell growth which
               is characteristic of malignancy.A number of attempts have been
               made to grade the malignancy of different breast tumors by
               distinguishing their histological characteristics, such as
               adenocarcinoma, medullary, scirrhus, colloid, etc.; but with the
               exception of adenocarcinoma and colloid, these divisions have
               proved of little value in prognosis.There the matter rested till

               Clinic, Broders published a paper suggesting the classification

              increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy
              number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to

              observations, these analyses suggest the following general
              conclusions about colorectal tumorigenesis: (i) It takes
              approximately 17 years for a large benign tumor to evolve into an
              advanced cancer but <2 years for cells within that cancer to
              acquire the ability to metastasize; (ii) it requires few, if any,
              selective events to transform a highly invasive cancer cell into
              one with the capacity to metastasize; (iii) the process of cell

              transcriptomics to study immune evasion and immunoediting in
              primary melanoma. We find that recurrent cellular neighborhoods

              along a progression axis involving precursor states, melanoma in

              already detectable in precursor regions. When tumors become
              locally invasive, a consolidated and spatially restricted
              suppressive environment forms along the tumor-stromal boundary.
              This environment is established by cytokine gradients that

              In lung adenocarcinoma, disease progression and prognosis are
              associated with the appearance of morphologically diverse tumor
              regions, termed histologic patterns. However, the link between
              molecular and histologic features remains elusive. Here, we
              generated multiomics and spatially resolved molecular profiles of
              histologic patterns from primary lung adenocarcinoma, which we
              integrated with molecular data from >2,000 patients. The
              transition from indolent to aggressive patterns was not driven by
              genetic alterations but by epigenetic and transcriptional

              PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in solid tumors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
              PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective study (October 1, 2012, to
              October 1, 2017) used a deidentified tumor database from a
              commercial company and annotated clinical records from a subset
              of patients treated at a university tertiary referral center. The
              study analyzed 118 187 tumors from the deidentified database,
              including a clinically annotated subgroup of 2039 malignant
              tumors. INTERVENTIONS: Comprehensive genomic profiling was
              performed on all samples to determine PDL1 amplification,
              microsatellite instability, and tumor mutational burden (TMB). A
              subset of patients was treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. MAIN
              OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prevalence of PDL1 amplification was
              determined among 118 187 patient samples that underwent
              next-generation sequencing. Solid tumors treated with checkpoint
              blockade were evaluated for response and progression-free
              survival (PFS). RESULTS: Of the 118 187 deidentified tumor
              samples, PDL1 amplifications were identified in 843 (0.7\%),
              including more than 100 types of solid tumors. Most
              PDL1-amplified tumors (84.8\%) had a low to intermediate TMB.
              PDL1 amplification did not always correlate with high-positive
              PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemical analysis. Six of 9
              patients (66.7\%) from 1 center with PDL1-amplified solid tumors
              had objective responses after checkpoint blockade administration.
              The median PFS among all treated patients was 15.2 months.
              Responders included 1 patient with glioblastoma (PFS, $\geq$5.2
              months), 2 patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer (PFS,
              $\geq$9 and 15.2 months), 2 patients with metastatic basal cell

              RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that PDL1
              amplification occurs in a small subset of malignant tumors.
              Additional large-scale, prospective studies of PDL1-amplified

              technologies. The development of computational methods plays
              important roles in extracting biological signals from raw data.
              Various approaches have been developed to overcome
              technology-specific limitations such as spatial resolution, gene
              coverage, sensitivity, and technical biases. Downstream analysis
              tools formulate spatial organization and cell-cell communications
              as quantifiable properties, and provide algorithms to derive such
              properties. Integrative pipelines further assemble multiple tools
              in one package, allowing biologists to conveniently analyze data
              from beginning to end. In this review, we summarize the state of
              the art of spatial transcriptomic data analysis methods and

              to accurately identify spatial domains by learning
              low-dimensional latent embeddings via integrating spatial
              information and gene expression profiles. To better characterize
              the spatial similarity at the boundary of spatial domains,
              STAGATE adopts an attention mechanism to adaptively learn the
              similarity of neighboring spots, and an optional cell type-aware
              module through integrating the pre-clustering of gene

              improve the identification accuracy of spatial domains, and
              denoise the data while preserving spatial expression patterns.

              mRNA transcripts as individually resolved spots in multiplexed
              images. However, molecular quantification has been severely
              limited by the computational challenges of segmenting poorly
              outlined, overlapping cells and of overcoming technical noise;
              the majority of transcripts are routinely discarded because they
              fall outside the segmentation boundaries. This lost information
              leads to less accurate gene count matrices and weakens downstream
              analyses, such as cell type or gene program identification.
              RESULTS: Here, we present Sparcle, a probabilistic model that
              reassigns transcripts to cells based on gene covariation patterns
              and incorporates spatial features such as distance to nucleus. We
              demonstrate its utility on both multiplexed error-robust

              probabilistic cell typing in situ sequencing, spatially resolved
              transcript amplicon readout mapping and MERFISH from Vizgen.
              Sparcle improves transcript assignment, providing more realistic
              per-cell quantification of each gene, better delineation of cell

              spatial transcriptomics has enabled genome-scale gene expression
              mapping2-5, but the ability to capture spatial epigenetic
              information of tissue at the cellular level and genome scale is
              lacking. Here we describe a method for spatially resolved
              chromatin accessibility profiling of tissue sections using
              next-generation sequencing (spatial-ATAC-seq) by combining in
              situ Tn5 transposition chemistry6 and microfluidic deterministic
              barcoding5. Profiling mouse embryos using spatial-ATAC-seq
              delineated tissue-region-specific epigenetic landscapes and
              identified gene regulators involved in the development of the
              central nervous system. Mapping the accessible genome in the
              mouse and human brain revealed the intricate arealization of
              brain regions. Applying spatial-ATAC-seq to tonsil tissue
              resolved the spatially distinct organization of immune cell types

              series of protocols to sequence the genomes of small populations
              of cells isolated from histological sections. Here, we describe a
              complete workflow that combines laser-capture microdissection
              (LCM) with low-input genome sequencing, while circumventing the
              use of whole-genome amplification (WGA). The protocol is
              subdivided broadly into four steps: tissue processing, LCM,
              low-input library generation and mutation calling and filtering.
              The tissue processing and LCM steps are provided as general
              guidelines that might require tailoring based on the specific
              requirements of the study at hand. Our protocol for low-input
              library generation uses enzymatic rather than acoustic
              fragmentation to generate WGA-free whole-genome libraries.
              Finally, the mutation calling and filtering strategy has been
              adapted from previously published protocols to account for
              artifacts introduced via library creation. To date, we have used
              this workflow to perform targeted and whole-genome sequencing of
              small populations of cells (typically 100-1,000 cells) in
              thousands of microbiopsies from a wide range of human tissues.
              The low-input DNA protocol is designed to be compatible with
              liquid handling platforms and make use of equipment and expertise
              standard to any core sequencing facility. However, obtaining
              low-input DNA material via LCM requires specialized equipment and
              expertise. The entire protocol from tissue reception through
              whole-genome library generation can be accomplished in as little

  abstract = "Crucial transitions in cancer-including tumor initiation, local
              expansion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance-involve complex
              interactions between cells within the dynamic tumor ecosystem.
              Transformative single-cell genomics technologies and spatial
              multiplex in situ methods now provide an opportunity to
              interrogate this complexity at unprecedented resolution. The
              Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), part of the National Cancer
              Institute (NCI) Cancer Moonshot Initiative, will establish a
              clinical, experimental, computational, and organizational
              framework to generate informative and accessible
              three-dimensional atlases of cancer transitions for a diverse set
              of tumor types. This effort complements both ongoing efforts to
              map healthy organs and previous large-scale cancer genomics
              approaches focused on bulk sequencing at a single point in time.
              Generating single-cell, multiparametric, longitudinal atlases and
              integrating them with clinical outcomes should help identify
              novel predictive biomarkers and features as well as
              therapeutically relevant cell types, cell states, and cellular
              interactions across transitions. The resulting tumor atlases
              should have a profound impact on our understanding of cancer
              biology and have the potential to improve cancer detection,
              prevention, and therapeutic discovery for better
              precision-medicine treatments of cancer patients and those at

  abstract = "Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively
              parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this
              variation at the whole-genome scale1-3. Here we report the
              integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their
              matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the
              Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the
              International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer
              Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG
              resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute
              clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations
              when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however,
              in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting
              that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
              in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single
              catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour
              evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede
              most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated
              genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance
              often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and
              show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to
              critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect
              patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations,
              structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection
              of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding
              mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4;
              identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base
              substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural
              variation5,6; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution7;
              describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic
              mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and
              promoter activity8,9; and evaluates a range of more-specialized

  abstract = "The evolutionary dynamics of tumor initiation remain
              undetermined, and the interplay between neoplastic cells and the
              immune system is hypothesized to be critical in transformation.
              Colorectal cancer (CRC) presents a unique opportunity to study
              the transition to malignancy as pre-cancers (adenomas) and
              early-stage cancers are frequently resected. Here, we examine
              tumor-immune eco-evolutionary dynamics from pre-cancer to
              carcinoma using a computational model, ecological analysis of
              digital pathology data, and neoantigen prediction in 62 patient
              samples. Modeling predicted recruitment of immunosuppressive
              cells would be the most common driver of transformation. As
              predicted, ecological analysis reveals that progressed adenomas
              co-localized with immunosuppressive cells and cytokines, while
              benign adenomas co-localized with a mixed immune response.
              Carcinomas converge to a common immune ``cold'' ecology, relaxing
              selection against immunogenicity and high neoantigen burdens,
              with little evidence for PD-L1 overexpression driving tumor
              initiation. These findings suggest re-engineering the
              immunosuppressive niche may prove an effective immunotherapy in

  abstract = "Most human tumours are heterogeneous, composed of cellular clones
              with different properties present at variable frequencies. Highly
              heterogeneous tumours have poor clinical outcomes, yet the
              underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show
              that minor subclones of breast cancer cells expressing IL11 and
              FIGF (VEGFD) cooperate to promote metastatic progression and
              generate polyclonal metastases composed of driver and neutral
              subclones. Expression profiling of the epithelial and stromal
              compartments of monoclonal and polyclonal primary and metastatic
              lesions revealed that this cooperation is indirect, mediated
              through the local and systemic microenvironments. We identified
              neutrophils as a leukocyte population stimulated by the
              IL11-expressing minor subclone and showed that the depletion of
              neutrophils prevents metastatic outgrowth. Single-cell RNA-seq of
              CD45+ cell populations from primary tumours, blood and lungs
              demonstrated that IL11 acts on bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal
              stromal cells, which induce pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic
              neutrophils. Our results indicate key roles for
              non-cell-autonomous drivers and minor subclones in metastasis.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The estimation of risk of recurrence for patients
              with colon carcinoma must be improved. A robust immune score
              quantification is needed to introduce immune parameters into
              cancer classification. The aim of the study was to assess the
              prognostic value of total tumour-infiltrating T-cell counts and
              cytotoxic tumour-infiltrating T-cells counts with the consensus
              Immunoscore assay in patients with stage I-III colon cancer.
              METHODS: An international consortium of 14 centres in 13
              countries, led by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer,
              assessed the Immunoscore assay in patients with TNM stage I-III
              colon cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to a training set,
              an internal validation set, or an external validation set.
              Paraffin sections of the colon tumour and invasive margin from
              each patient were processed by immunohistochemistry, and the
              densities of CD3+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumour and in
              the invasive margin were quantified by digital pathology. An
              Immunoscore for each patient was derived from the mean of four
              density percentiles. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the
              prognostic value of the Immunoscore for time to recurrence,
              defined as time from surgery to disease recurrence. Stratified
              multivariable Cox models were used to assess the associations
              between Immunoscore and outcomes, adjusting for potential
              confounders. Harrell's C-statistics was used to assess model
              performance. FINDINGS: Tissue samples from 3539 patients were
              processed, and samples from 2681 patients were included in the
              analyses after quality controls (700 patients in the training
              set, 636 patients in the internal validation set, and 1345
              patients in the external validation set). The Immunoscore assay
              showed a high level of reproducibility between observers and
              centres (r=0·97 for colon tumour; r=0·97 for invasive margin;
              p<0·0001). In the training set, patients with a high Immunoscore
              had the lowest risk of recurrence at 5 years (14 [8\%] patients
              with a high Immunoscore vs 65 (19\%) patients with an
              intermediate Immunoscore vs 51 (32\%) patients with a low
              Immunoscore; hazard ratio [HR] for high vs low Immunoscore 0·20,
              95\% CI 0·10-0·38; p<0·0001). The findings were confirmed in the
              two validation sets (n=1981). In the stratified Cox multivariable
              analysis, the Immunoscore association with time to recurrence was
              independent of patient age, sex, T stage, N stage, microsatellite
              instability, and existing prognostic factors (p<0·0001). Of 1434
              patients with stage II cancer, the difference in risk of
              recurrence at 5 years was significant (HR for high vs low
              Immunoscore 0·33, 95\% CI 0·21-0·52; p<0·0001), including in Cox
              multivariable analysis (p<0·0001). Immunoscore had the highest
              relative contribution to the risk of all clinical parameters,
              including the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for
              International Cancer Control TNM classification system.
              INTERPRETATION: The Immunoscore provides a reliable estimate of
              the risk of recurrence in patients with colon cancer. These
              results support the implementation of the consensus Immunoscore
              as a new component of a TNM-Immune classification of cancer.

              immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence (mIHC/IF) assays have
              been used to assess pretreatment tumor tissue to predict response
              to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. However, the relative diagnostic
              performance of these modalities has yet to be established.
              OBJECTIVE: To compare studies that assessed the diagnostic
              accuracy of PD-L1 IHC, TMB, GEP, and mIHC/IF in predicting
              response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A search of
              PubMed (from inception to June 2018) and 2013 to 2018 annual
              meeting abstracts from the American Association for Cancer
              Research, American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society
              for Medical Oncology, and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer was
              conducted to identify studies that examined the use of PD-L1 IHC,
              TMB, GEP, and mIHC/IF assays to determine objective response to
              anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. For PD-L1 IHC, only clinical trials that
              resulted in US Food and Drug Administration approval of
              indications for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 were included. Studies combining
              more than 1 modality were also included. Preferred Reporting
              Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines were
              followed. Two reviewers independently extracted the clinical
              outcomes and test results for each individual study. MAIN
              OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Summary receiver operating characteristic
              (sROC) curves; their associated area under the curve (AUC); and
              pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
              values (PPV, NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios
              (LR+ and LR-) for each assay modality. RESULTS: Tumor specimens
              representing over 10 different solid tumor types in 8135 patients
              were assayed, and the results were correlated with
              anti-PD-1/PD-L1 response. When each modality was evaluated with
              sROC curves, mIHC/IF had a significantly higher AUC (0.79)
              compared with PD-L1 IHC (AUC, 0.65, P < .001), GEP (AUC, 0.65, P
              = .003), and TMB (AUC, 0.69, P = .049). When multiple different
              modalities were combined such as PD-L1 IHC and/or GEP + TMB, the
              AUC drew nearer to that of mIHC/IF (0.74). All modalities
              demonstrated comparable NPV and LR-, whereas mIHC/IF demonstrated
              higher PPV (0.63) and LR+ (2.86) than the other approaches.
              CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this meta-analysis, tumor
              mutational burden, PD-L1 IHC, and GEP demonstrated comparable
              AUCs in predicting response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.
              Multiplex immunohistochemistry/IF and multimodality biomarker
              strategies appear to be associated with improved performance over
              PD-L1 IHC, TMB, or GEP alone. Further studies with mIHC/IF and
              composite approaches with a larger number of patients will be
              required to confirm these findings. Additional study is also
              required to determine the most predictive analyte combinations
              and to determine whether biomarker modality performance varies by
              tumor type.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The morphological evaluation of tumor-infiltrating
              lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer (BC) is gaining momentum as
              evidence strengthens for the clinical relevance of this
              immunological biomarker. Accumulating evidence suggests that the
              extent of lymphocytic infiltration in tumor tissue can be
              assessed as a major parameter by evaluation of hematoxylin and
              eosin (H\&E)-stained tumor sections. TILs have been shown to
              provide prognostic and potentially predictive value, particularly
              in triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor
              2-overexpressing BC. DESIGN: A standardized methodology for
              evaluating TILs is now needed as a prerequisite for integrating
              this parameter in standard histopathological practice, in a
              research setting as well as in clinical trials. This article
              reviews current data on the clinical validity and utility of TILs
              in BC in an effort to foster better knowledge and insight in this
              rapidly evolving field, and to develop a standardized methodology
              for visual assessment on H\&E sections, acknowledging the future
              potential of molecular/multiplexed approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The
              methodology provided is sufficiently detailed to offer a
              uniformly applied, pragmatic starting point and improve
              consistency and reproducibility in the measurement of TILs for

              associated with prognosis in various tumours. However, this
              finding remains controversial in non-small cell lung cancer
              (NSCLC). We performed this meta-analysis systematically to
              evaluate the prognostic value of TILs in NSCLC. METHODS: The
              references were collected by searching the PubMed, EMBASE and Web
              of Science databases. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\%
              confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized using random or fixed
              effects models to evaluate the association between TILs and NSCLC
              survival outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 45 interrelated studies
              were eligible that included 11,448 patients. Pooled analysis
              showed that a high density of TILs indicated a better overall
              survival (HR = 0.80, 0.70-0.89) and progression-free survival (HR
              = 0.73, 0.61-0.85) for patients with NSCLC; a high density of
              CD3+ TILs in the tumour nest indicated a better overall survival
              (HR = 0.84, 0.69-0.99) and disease-specific survival (HR = 0.57,
              0.34-0.80); a high density of CD4+ TILs in the tumor nest
              indicated a favourable overall survival (HR = 0.86, 0.76-0.96); a
              high density of CD8+ TILs indicated a favourable overall survival
              (HR = 0.995, 0.99-1.0), progression-free survival (HR = 0.52,
              0.34-0.71), disease-free survival (HR = 0.64, 0.43-0.85),
              relapse/recurrence-free survival (HR = 0.42, 0.18-0.67) and
              disease-specific survival (HR = 0.56, 0.35-0.78); and a high
              density of CD20+ TILs in the tumour nest indicated a favourable
              overall survival (HR = 0.65, 0.36-0.94). However, a high density
              of Foxp3+ TILs in the tumour stroma indicated a worse
              relapse/recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.90, 1.05-2.76) in NSCLC.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis confirmed that high densities of
              TILs, CD3+TILs, CD4+TILs, CD8+TILs and CD20+TILs in the tumour
              nest are favourable prognostic biomarkers for patients with
              NSCLC, and Foxp3+TILs in the tumour stroma are a poor prognostic

              subsets may also contribute to anti-tumour immunity11-15,
              although these have been less well-studied in ICB treatment16. A
              previously conducted neoadjuvant ICB trial in patients with

              prognostic significance, particularly in triple-negative breast
              cancer (TNBC). One important source of TILs in breast cancer is
              tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). OBJECTIVE: To carry out a
              histological analysis of surgically resected TNBC to identify the
              location of TLSs, the relationship between TLSs and TILs and
              their prognostic significance in TNBC. METHODS: We
              retrospectively analysed 769 patients with TNBC. RESULTS: TILs
              were defined as the percentage of stroma of invasive carcinoma
              infiltrated by lymphocytes. TLSs were mainly present within
              adjacent terminal duct lobular units and around in situ
              components. TNBC with higher levels of TILs showed a higher
              nuclear grade, lower lymphovascular invasion, less accompanying
              in situ component, a homogeneous growth pattern, necrosis in
              invasive areas, low levels of tumour stroma, high levels of
              peritumoral lymphocytic infiltration and moderate to abundant
              TLSs in adjacent tissue. TILs, the degree of peritumoral
              lymphocytic infiltration and adjacent TLSs were prognostic
              factors for disease-free and overall survival. Although the TIL
              level did not have a prognostic value in stage I, it added
              significant prognostic information for stages II and III.
              Conversely, patients with high levels of TILs did not show
              prognostic differences according to the pTNM stage. Patients with
              high levels of TILs (> 60\%) and moderate to abundant TLSs had
              significantly better disease-free survival than those with high
              levels of TILs but none or few TLSs. CONCLUSIONS: TLSs are
              frequently present in TNBC and are closely associated with TILs.
              TILs provide additional prognostic information in patients with
              TNBC with a higher pTNM stage.",

              survival in patients with clinically localized primary cutaneous
              melanoma. METHODS: From the Melanoma Institute Australia
              database, 1,865 patients with a single primary melanoma $\geq$
              0.75 mm in thickness were identified. The associations of
              clinical and pathologic factors with SLN status, recurrence-free
              survival (RFS), and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) were
              analyzed. RESULTS: The majority of patients had either no (TIL
              grade 0; 35.4\%) or few (TIL grade 1; 45.1\%) TILs, with a
              minority showing moderate (TIL grade 2; 16.3\%) or marked (TIL
              grade 3; 3.2\%) TILs. Tumor thickness, mitotic rate, and Clark
              level were inversely correlated with TIL grade (each P < .001).
              SLN biopsy was performed in 1,138 patients (61.0\%) and was
              positive in 252 (22.1\%). There was a significant inverse
              association between SLN status and TIL grade (SLN positivity
              rates for each TIL grade: 0, 27.8\%; 1, 20.1\%; 2, 18.3\%; 3,
              5.6\%; P < .001). Predictors of SLN positivity were decreasing
              age (P < .001), decreasing TIL grade (P < .001), ulceration (P =
              .003), increasing tumor thickness (P = .01), satellitosis (P =
              .03), and increasing mitoses (P = .03). The 5-year MSS and RFS
              rates were 83\% and 76\%, respectively (median follow-up, 43
              months). Tumor thickness (P < .001), ulceration (P < .001),
              satellitosis (P < .001), mitotic rate (P = .003), TIL grade (P <
              .001), and sex (P = .01) were independent predictors of MSS.
              Patients with TIL grade 3 tumors had 100\% survival. CONCLUSION:
              TIL grade is an independent predictor of survival and SLN status
              in patients with melanoma. Patients with a pronounced TIL
              infiltrate have an excellent prognosis.",

              between the stroma, tumor cells, and distinct TIL subsets remains
              a substantial challenge in immune oncology. To properly study
              this interplay, quantifying spatial relationships of multiple
              cell types within the tumor microenvironment is crucial. To
              address this, we used cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF) imaging

              35 protein markers, characterizing the microenvironment of 5

  abstract = "Disseminated cancer cells from primary tumours can seed in distal
              tissues, but may take several years to form overt metastases, a
              phenomenon that is termed tumour dormancy. Despite its importance
              in metastasis and residual disease, few studies have been able to
              successfully characterize dormancy within melanoma. Here we show
              that the aged lung microenvironment facilitates a permissive
              niche for efficient outgrowth of dormant disseminated cancer
              cells-in contrast to the aged skin, in which age-related changes
              suppress melanoma growth but drive dissemination. These
              microenvironmental complexities can be explained by the phenotype
              switching model, which argues that melanoma cells switch between
              a proliferative cell state and a slower-cycling, invasive
              state1-3. It was previously shown that dermal fibroblasts promote
              phenotype switching in melanoma during ageing4-8. We now identify
              WNT5A as an activator of dormancy in melanoma disseminated cancer
              cells within the lung, which initially enables the efficient
              dissemination and seeding of melanoma cells in metastatic niches.
              Age-induced reprogramming of lung fibroblasts increases their
              secretion of the soluble WNT antagonist sFRP1, which inhibits
              WNT5A in melanoma cells and thereby enables efficient metastatic
              outgrowth. We also identify the tyrosine kinase receptors AXL and
              MER as promoting a dormancy-to-reactivation axis within melanoma
              cells. Overall, we find that age-induced changes in distal
              metastatic microenvironments promote the efficient reactivation
              of dormant melanoma cells in the lung.",

              however, the temporal dynamics that dictate the generation of
              metastasis-competent CTCs are largely uncharacterized, and it is
              often assumed that CTCs are constantly shed from growing tumours
              or are shed as a consequence of mechanical insults1. Here we
              observe a striking and unexpected pattern of CTC generation
              dynamics in both patients with breast cancer and mouse models,
              highlighting that most spontaneous CTC intravasation events occur
              during sleep. Further, we demonstrate that rest-phase CTCs are
              highly prone to metastasize, whereas CTCs generated during the
              active phase are devoid of metastatic ability. Mechanistically,
              single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of CTCs reveals a marked
              upregulation of mitotic genes exclusively during the rest phase
              in both patients and mouse models, enabling metastasis
              proficiency. Systemically, we find that key circadian rhythm
              hormones such as melatonin, testosterone and glucocorticoids
              dictate CTC generation dynamics, and as a consequence, that
              insulin directly promotes tumour cell proliferation in vivo, yet
              in a time-dependent manner. Thus, the spontaneous generation of
              CTCs with a high proclivity to metastasize does not occur
              continuously, but it is concentrated within the rest phase of the
              affected individual, providing a new rationale for
              time-controlled interrogation and treatment of metastasis-prone

              cancer typically harbours multiple genetically distinct
              subclones. As carcinogenesis involves a breakdown in the
              cell-cell cooperation that normally maintains epithelial tissue
              architecture, individual subclones within a malignant
              microenvironment are commonly depicted as self-interested
              competitors. Alternatively, breast cancer subclones might
              interact cooperatively to gain a selective growth advantage in
              some cases. Although interclonal cooperation has been shown to
              drive tumorigenesis in fruitfly models, definitive evidence for
              functional cooperation between epithelial tumour cell subclones
              in mammals is lacking. Here we use mouse models of breast cancer
              to show that interclonal cooperation can be essential for tumour
              maintenance. Aberrant expression of the secreted signalling
              molecule Wnt1 generates mixed-lineage mammary tumours composed of
              basal and luminal tumour cell subtypes, which purportedly derive
              from a bipotent malignant progenitor cell residing atop a tumour
              cell hierarchy. Using somatic Hras mutations as clonal markers,
              we show that some Wnt tumours indeed conform to a hierarchical
              configuration, but that others unexpectedly harbour genetically
              distinct basal Hras mutant and luminal Hras wild-type subclones.
              Both subclones are required for efficient tumour propagation,
              which strictly depends on luminally produced Wnt1. When biclonal
              tumours were challenged with Wnt withdrawal to simulate targeted
              therapy, analysis of tumour regression and relapse revealed that
              basal subclones recruit heterologous Wnt-producing cells to
              restore tumour growth. Alternatively, in the absence of a
              substitute Wnt source, the original subclones often evolve to
              rescue Wnt pathway activation and drive relapse, either by
              restoring cooperation or by switching to a defector strategy.
              Uncovering similar modes of interclonal cooperation in human

              anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) therapy in patients with melanoma
              are durable, lasting for years, but delayed relapses have been
              noted long after initial objective tumor regression despite
              continuous therapy. Mechanisms of immune escape in this context
              are unknown. METHODS: We analyzed biopsy samples from paired
              baseline and relapsing lesions in four patients with metastatic
              melanoma who had had an initial objective tumor regression in
              response to anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab) followed by disease
              progression months to years later. RESULTS: Whole-exome
              sequencing detected clonal selection and outgrowth of the
              acquired resistant tumors and, in two of the four patients,
              revealed resistance-associated loss-of-function mutations in the
              genes encoding interferon-receptor-associated Janus kinase 1
              (JAK1) or Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), concurrent with deletion of the
              wild-type allele. A truncating mutation in the gene encoding the
              antigen-presenting protein beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) was
              identified in a third patient. JAK1 and JAK2 truncating mutations
              resulted in a lack of response to interferon gamma, including
              insensitivity to its antiproliferative effects on cancer cells.
              The B2M truncating mutation led to loss of surface expression of
              major histocompatibility complex class I. CONCLUSIONS: In this
              study, acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in
              patients with melanoma was associated with defects in the
              pathways involved in interferon-receptor signaling and in antigen

              lymphocytes kill more immunogenic cancer cells to cause less
              immunogenic clones to dominate a population. Although proven in
              mice1,3, whether immunoediting occurs naturally in human cancers
              remains unclear. Here, to address this, we investigate how 70
              human pancreatic cancers evolved over 10 years. We find that,
              despite having more time to accumulate mutations, rare long-term
              survivors of pancreatic cancer who have stronger T cell activity
              in primary tumours develop genetically less heterogeneous
              recurrent tumours with fewer immunogenic mutations (neoantigens).
              To quantify whether immunoediting underlies these observations,
              we infer that a neoantigen is immunogenic (high-quality) by two
              features-'non-selfness' based on neoantigen similarity to known
              antigens4,5, and 'selfness' based on the antigenic distance
              required for a neoantigen to differentially bind to the MHC or
              activate a T cell compared with its wild-type peptide. Using
              these features, we estimate cancer clone fitness as the aggregate
              cost of T cells recognizing high-quality neoantigens offset by
              gains from oncogenic mutations. With this model, we predict the
              clonal evolution of tumours to reveal that long-term survivors of
              pancreatic cancer develop recurrent tumours with fewer
              high-quality neoantigens. Thus, we submit evidence that that the
              human immune system naturally edits neoantigens. Furthermore, we
              present a model to predict how immune pressure induces cancer
              cell populations to evolve over time. More broadly, our results
              argue that the immune system fundamentally surveils host genetic
              changes to suppress cancer.",

              neoantigens in the tumour antigen MUC16 (also known as CA125). A

              homology to infectious disease-derived peptides identified

              neoantigen quantity model ascribing greater immunogenicity to
              increasing neoantigen number alone did not. We detected
              intratumoural and lasting circulating T-cell reactivity to both
              high-quality and MUC16 neoantigens in long-term survivors of

              (EAC) present with de novo tumors. Although this could be due to
              inadequate screening strategies, the precise reason for this
              observation is not clear. We compared survival of patients with
              prevalent EAC with and without synchronous Barrett esophagus (BE)
              with intestinal metaplasia (IM) at the time of EAC diagnosis.
              METHODS: Clinical data were studied using Cox proportional
              hazards regression to evaluate the effect of synchronous BE-IM on
              EAC survival independent of age, sex, TNM stage, and tumor
              location. We analyzed data from a cohort of patients with EAC
              from the Mayo Clinic (n=411; 203 with BE and IM) and a
              multicenter cohort from the United Kingdom (n=1417; 638 with BE
              and IM). RESULTS: In the Mayo cohort, BE with IM had a reduced
              risk of death compared to patients without BE and IM (hazard
              ratio [HR] 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.34-0.57; P<.001). In a multivariable
              analysis, BE with IM was associated with longer survival
              independent of patient age or sex, tumor stage or location, and
              BE length (adjusted HR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.5-0.88; P=.005). In the
              United Kingdom cohort, patients BE and IM had a reduced risk of
              death compared with those without (HR, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.5-0.69;
              P<.001), with continued significance in multivariable analysis

              location (adjusted HR, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.64-0.93; P=.006).

              large bowel; however, regarding left colon and rectum, the male:

              however, adenocarcinoma with concomitant adenoma (i.e.,
              presumably arising in adenoma) was observed in 14.3\% of cancers
              of the left colon, in 17.7\% of rectal tumors, but in only 5.7\%
              of neoplasms of the proximal colon (P less than 0.05 and P less
              than 0.01, respectively, vs. left colon and rectum). Some
              histological features (carcinoid and mucinous carcinoma) were
              observed in right-side tumors only. Analysis of the familial
              occurrence of cancer showed that a significantly larger
              proportion of patients with neoplasms located in proximal colonic
              segments had three or more first-degree relatives affected by (or
              deceased from) cancer of all sites. Similarly, colorectal tumors
              among relatives were more frequent in patients with right-side
              cancer. The location of the 793 polyps observed during 3 years of
              registration showed that more than 70\% of adenomas were located
              beyond the splenic flexure, overlapping the distribution of
              cancers. In conclusion, the differences of sex ratio at different
              colonic subsites, the higher fraction of adenocarcinomas with
              adenomas in cancer of the more distal tracts of the large bowel,
              and the more marked familial occurrence of colorectal cancer in
              patients with right-side neoplasms tend to support the view that
              cancer of the proximal colon, cancer of the distal colon, and
              cancer of the rectum may actually be three different types of

              co-existing ductal carcinoma in situ component (IDC + DCIS).
              Studies have suggested that pure IDC may exhibit different
              biological behavior than IDC + DCIS, but whether this translates
              to a difference in outcomes is unclear. Here, utilizing the
              National Cancer Database we identified 494,801 stage I-III breast
              cancer patients diagnosed with either IDC alone or IDC + DCIS. We
              found that IDC + DCIS was associated with significantly better
              overall survival (OS) compared to IDC alone (5-year OS, 89.3\%
              vs. 85.5\%, p < 0.001), and this finding persisted on
              multivariable Cox modeling adjusting for demographic, clinical,
              and treatment-related variables. The significantly superior OS
              observed for IDC + DCIS was limited to patients with invasive
              tumor size < 4 cm or with node negative disease. A greater
              improvement in OS was observed for tumors containing $\geq$25\%

              lower T/N stage, low/intermediate grade, ER/PR positivity, and
              receipt of mastectomy. Thus, the presence of a DCIS component in
              patients with IDC is associated with favorable clinical
              characteristics and independently predicts improved OS. IDC +
              DCIS could be a useful prognostic factor for patients with breast

              treatment has become the first clinically approved targeted
              therapy in bladder cancer. However, it requires previous
              molecular testing of each patient, which is costly and not
              ubiquitously available. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an
              artificial intelligence system is able to predict mutations of
              the FGFR3 gene directly from routine histology slides of bladder
              cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We trained a deep
              learning network to detect FGFR3 mutations on digitized slides of
              muscle-invasive bladder cancers stained with hematoxylin and
              eosin from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n = 327) and
              validated the algorithm on the ``Aachen'' cohort (n = 182; n =
              121 pT2-4, n = 34 stroma-invasive pT1, and n = 27 noninvasive pTa
              tumors). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The
              primary endpoint was the area under the receiver operating curve
              (AUROC) for mutation detection. Performance of the deep learning
              system was compared with visual scoring by an uropathologist.
              RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In the TCGA cohort, FGFR3 mutations were
              detected with an AUROC of 0.701 (p < 0.0001). In the Aachen
              cohort, FGFR3 mutants were found with an AUROC of 0.725 (p <
              0.0001). When trained on TCGA, the network generalized to the
              Aachen cohort, and detected FGFR3 mutants with an AUROC of 0.625
              (p = 0.0112). A subgroup analysis and histological evaluation
              found highest accuracy in papillary growth, luminal gene
              expression subtypes, females, and American Joint Committee on
              Cancer (AJCC) stage II tumors. In a head-to-head comparison, the
              deep learning system outperformed the uropathologist in detecting
              FGFR3 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our computer-based artificial
              intelligence system was able to detect genetic alterations of the
              FGFR3 gene of bladder cancer patients directly from histological
              slides. In the future, this system could be used to preselect
              patients for further molecular testing. However, analyses of
              larger, multicenter, muscle-invasive bladder cancer cohorts are
              now needed in order to validate and extend our findings. PATIENT
              SUMMARY: In this report, a computer-based artificial intelligence
              (AI) system was applied to histological slides to predict genetic
              alterations of the FGFR3 gene in bladder cancer. We found that
              the AI system was able to find the alteration with high accuracy.

              understanding the roles of natural killer (NK) cells in immunity
              to tumours and viruses. NK cells are cytotoxic innate lymphoid
              cells that produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. By
              lysing transformed or infected cells, they limit tumour growth
              and viral infections. Whereas T cells recognize peptides
              presented by MHC molecules, NK cells display receptors that
              recognize stress-induced autologous proteins on cancer cells. At
              the same time, their functional activity is inhibited by MHC
              molecules displayed on such cells. The enormous potential of NK
              cells for immunotherapy for cancer is illustrated by their broad
              recognition of stressed cells regardless of neoantigen
              presentation, and enhanced activity against tumours that have
              lost expression of MHC class I owing to acquired resistance
              mechanisms. As a result, many efforts are under way to mobilize
              endogenous NK cells with therapeutics, or to provide populations
              of ex vivo-expanded NK cells as a cellular therapy, in some cases
              by equipping the NK cells with chimeric antigen receptors. Here

              functional programs of ascites cells, including immunomodulatory
              fibroblast sub-populations and dichotomous macrophage

              better understanding of disease progression and response to
              therapies therefore remains of utmost importance. Here, we
              characterize the genomic differences between early-stage
              untreated primary tumors and late-stage treated metastatic tumors
              using a harmonized pan-cancer (re-)analysis of 7,152
              whole-genome-sequenced tumors. In general, our analysis shows
              that metastatic tumors have a low intra-tumor heterogeneity, high
              genomic instability and increased frequency of structural
              variants with comparatively a modest increase in the number of
              small genetic variants. However, these differences are cancer
              type specific and are heavily impacted by the exposure to cancer
              therapies. Five cancer types, namely breast, prostate, thyroid,
              kidney clear carcinoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine, are a clear
              exception to the rule, displaying an extensive transformation of
              their genomic landscape in advanced stages. These changes were
              supported by increased genomic instability and involved
              substantial differences in tumor mutation burden, clock-based
              molecular signatures and the landscape of driver alterations as
              well as a pervasive increase in structural variant burden. The
              majority of cancer types had either moderate genomic differences
              (e.g., cervical and colorectal cancers) or highly consistent
              genomic portraits (e.g., ovarian cancer and skin melanoma) when
              comparing early- and late-stage disease. Exposure to treatment
              further scars the tumor genome and introduces an evolutionary
              bottleneck that selects for known therapy-resistant drivers in
              approximately half of treated patients. Our data showcases the
              potential of whole-genome analysis to understand tumor evolution
              and provides a valuable resource to further investigate the

              pan-cancer study of metastatic solid tumour genomes, including
              whole-genome sequencing data for 2,520 pairs of tumour and normal
              tissue, analysed at median depths of 106$\times$ and 38$\times$,
              respectively, and surveying more than 70 million somatic
              variants. The characteristic mutations of metastatic lesions
              varied widely, with mutations that reflect those of the primary
              tumour types, and with high rates of whole-genome duplication
              events (56\%). Individual metastatic lesions were relatively
              homogeneous, with the vast majority (96\%) of driver mutations
              being clonal and up to 80\% of tumour-suppressor genes being
              inactivated bi-allelically by different mutational mechanisms.
              Although metastatic tumour genomes showed similar mutational

              metastases, primary tumors, and normal tissue. In all clonally
              related cancer samples, we observed branched evolution, where all
              metastatic and primary sites shared a common ancestor yet
              continued to evolve independently. In 53\% of cases, we found
              potentially clinically informative alterations in the brain
              metastases not detected in the matched primary-tumor sample. In
              contrast, spatially and temporally separated brain metastasis

              demonstrate that clinically actionable alterations present in

  abstract = "Cancers emerge from an ongoing Darwinian evolutionary process,

              primary tumour. This evolutionary process culminates in the
              formation of metastases, which is the cause of 90\% of
              cancer-related deaths. However, despite its clinical importance,
              little is known about the principles governing the dissemination
              of cancer cells to distant organs. Although the hypothesis that
              each metastasis originates from a single tumour cell is generally
              supported, recent studies using mouse models of cancer
              demonstrated the existence of polyclonal seeding from and
              interclonal cooperation between multiple subclones. Here we
              sought definitive evidence for the existence of polyclonal
              seeding in human malignancy and to establish the clonal
              relationship among different metastases in the context of
              androgen-deprived metastatic prostate cancer. Using whole-genome
              sequencing, we characterized multiple metastases arising from
              prostate tumours in ten patients. Integrated analyses of
              subclonal architecture revealed the patterns of metastatic spread

              found to be common, either through de novo monoclonal seeding of
              daughter metastases or, in five cases, through the transfer of
              multiple tumour clones between metastatic sites. Lesions
              affecting tumour suppressor genes usually occur as single events,
              whereas mutations in genes involved in androgen receptor

              and medical oncologists from 19 different countries gathered in a
              consensus conference to update the grading of prostate cancer,
              last revised in 2005. The major conclusions were: (1) Cribriform
              glands should be assigned a Gleason pattern 4, regardless of
              morphology; (2) Glomeruloid glands should be assigned a Gleason
              pattern 4, regardless of morphology; (3) Grading of mucinous
              carcinoma of the prostate should be based on its underlying
              growth pattern rather than grading them all as pattern 4; and (4)
              Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate without invasive carcinoma
              should not be assigned a Gleason grade and a comment as to its
              invariable association with aggressive prostate cancer should be
              made. Regarding morphologies of Gleason patterns, there was clear
              consensus on: (1) Gleason pattern 4 includes cribriform, fused,
              and poorly formed glands; (2) The term hypernephromatoid cancer
              should not be used; (3) For a diagnosis of Gleason pattern 4, it
              needs to be seen at 10x lens magnification; (4)
              Occasional/seemingly poorly formed or fused glands between
              well-formed glands is insufficient for a diagnosis of pattern 4;
              (5) In cases with borderline morphology between Gleason pattern 3
              and pattern 4 and crush artifacts, the lower grade should be
              favored; (6) Branched glands are allowed in Gleason pattern 3;
              (7) Small solid cylinders represent Gleason pattern 5; (8) Solid
              medium to large nests with rosette-like spaces should be
              considered to represent Gleason pattern 5; and (9) Presence of
              unequivocal comedonecrosis, even if focal is indicative of
              Gleason pattern 5. It was recognized by both pathologists and
              clinicians that despite the above changes, there were
              deficiencies with the Gleason system. The Gleason grading system
              ranges from 2 to 10, yet 6 is the lowest score currently
              assigned. When patients are told that they have a Gleason score 6
              out of 10, it implies that their prognosis is intermediate and
              contributes to their fear of having a more aggressive cancer.
              Also, in the literature and for therapeutic purposes, various
              scores have been incorrectly grouped together with the assumption
              that they have a similar prognosis. For example, many
              classification systems consider Gleason score 7 as a single score
              without distinguishing 3+4 versus 4+3, despite studies showing
              significantly worse prognosis for the latter. The basis for a new
              grading system was proposed in 2013 by one of the authors
              (J.I.E.) based on data from Johns Hopkins Hospital resulting in 5
              prognostically distinct Grade Groups. This new system was
              validated in a multi-institutional study of over 20,000 radical
              prostatectomy specimens, over 16,000 needle biopsy specimens, and
              over 5,000 biopsies followed by radiation therapy. There was
              broad (90\%) consensus for the adoption of this new prostate
              cancer Grading system in the 2014 consensus conference based on:
              (1) the new classification provided more accurate stratification
              of tumors than the current system; (2) the classification
              simplified the number of grading categories from Gleason scores 2
              to 10, with even more permutations based on different pattern
              combinations, to Grade Groups 1 to 5; (3) the lowest grade is 1
              not 6 as in Gleason, with the potential to reduce overtreatment
              of indolent cancer; and (4) the current modified Gleason grading,
              which forms the basis for the new grade groups, bears little
              resemblance to the original Gleason system. The new grades would,
              for the foreseeable future, be used in conjunction with the
              Gleason system [ie. Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade Group 1)]. The new
              grading system and the terminology Grade Groups 1-5 have also
              been accepted by the World Health Organization for the 2016

              grading has not been accepted as a routine procedure, mainly
              because of perceived problems with reproducibility and
              consistency. In the Nottingham/Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer
              Study the most commonly used method, described by Bloom \&
              Richardson, has been modified in order to make the criteria more
              objective. The revised technique involves semiquantitative
              evaluation of three morphological features--the percentage of
              tubule formation, the degree of nuclear pleomorphism and an
              accurate mitotic count using a defined field area. A numerical
              scoring system is used and the overall grade is derived from a
              summation of individual scores for the three variables: three
              grades of differentiation are used. Since 1973, over 2200
              patients with primary operable breast cancer have been entered
              into a study of multiple prognostic factors. Histological grade,
              assessed in 1831 patients, shows a very strong correlation with
              prognosis; patients with grade I tumours have a significantly
              better survival than those with grade II and III tumours (P less
              than 0.0001). These results demonstrate that this method for
              histological grading provides important prognostic information
              and, if the grading protocol is followed consistently,
              reproducible results can be obtained. Histological grade forms

              but impede carcinogenesis[1][1]--[3][2]. Here we test this
              hypothesis. Visualizing and sequencing NOTCH1 mutant clones in
              aging normal human esophagus reveals frequent biallelic mutations
              that block NOTCH1 signaling. In mouse esophagus, heterozygous
              Notch1 mutation confers a competitive advantage over wild type
              cells, an effect enhanced by loss of the second allele. Notch1
              loss alters transcription but has minimal effects on epithelial
              structure and cell dynamics. In a carcinogenesis model, Notch1
              mutations were less prevalent in tumors than normal epithelium.
              Deletion of Notch1 reduced tumor growth, an effect recapitulated
              by anti-NOTCH1 antibody treatment. We conclude that Notch1
              mutations in normal epithelium are beneficial as wild type Notch1

              prevalence of NOTCH1 and FAT1 mutations in forearm, trunk, and

              fitness of proliferating cells10-12. Thus, normal adult tissues
              become a patchwork of mutant clones competing for space and

              age. These cancers are associated with recurrent somatic
              mutations in specific genes. We hypothesized that such mutations
              would be detectable in the blood of some persons who are not
              known to have hematologic disorders. METHODS: We analyzed
              whole-exome sequencing data from DNA in the peripheral-blood
              cells of 17,182 persons who were unselected for hematologic
              phenotypes. We looked for somatic mutations by identifying
              previously characterized single-nucleotide variants and small
              insertions or deletions in 160 genes that are recurrently mutated
              in hematologic cancers. The presence of mutations was analyzed
              for an association with hematologic phenotypes, survival, and
              cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Detectable somatic mutations were
              rare in persons younger than 40 years of age but rose appreciably
              in frequency with age. Among persons 70 to 79 years of age, 80 to
              89 years of age, and 90 to 108 years of age, these clonal
              mutations were observed in 9.5\% (219 of 2300 persons), 11.7\%
              (37 of 317), and 18.4\% (19 of 103), respectively. The majority
              of the variants occurred in three genes: DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1.
              The presence of a somatic mutation was associated with an
              increase in the risk of hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 11.1;
              95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 32.6), an increase in
              all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.8), and

              unselected for cancer or hematologic phenotypes. We identified

              used data from Swedish national patient registers to follow
              health outcomes for 2 to 7 years after DNA sampling. RESULTS:
              Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations was observed in 10\%
              of persons older than 65 years of age but in only 1\% of those
              younger than 50 years of age. Detectable clonal expansions most
              frequently involved somatic mutations in three genes (DNMT3A,

              hematologic cancers in this cohort arose in persons who had
              clonality at the time of DNA sampling, more than 6 months before

              increased risks of hematologic cancer and death. A subset of the

              frequently mutated in apparently healthy persons; these mutations

              research has focused on identifying population structures that

              these amplifiers of natural selection typically increase fixation

              that substantially augment the fixation probability with just a
              minor increase in fixation time. Finally, we show that those

              the evolutionary process. A particularly marked effect comes from
              population structure, which can affect the probability that new
              mutations reach fixation. Our interest is in population
              structures, such as those depicted by 'star graphs', that amplify
              the effects of selection by further increasing the fixation
              probability of advantageous mutants and decreasing the fixation
              probability of disadvantageous mutants. The fact that star graphs
              increase the fixation probability of beneficial mutations has
              lead to the conclusion that evolution proceeds more rapidly in
              star-structured populations, compared with mixed (unstructured)
              populations. Here, we show that the effects of population
              structure on the rate of evolution are more complex and subtle
              than previously recognized and draw attention to the importance
              of fixation time. By comparing population structures that amplify
              selection with other population structures, both analytically and
              numerically, we show that evolution can slow down substantially

              denote reproductive rates which govern how often individuals
              place offspring into adjacent vertices. The homogeneous
              population, described by the Moran process, is the special case
              of a fully connected graph with evenly weighted edges. Spatial

              proliferation at the tumor's edge and vice-versa for the

              growth but accelerates the rate of evolution for both

              ever higher values for proliferation and migration, while a
              convex tradeoff tends to favor proliferation, often promoting the
              coexistence of a generalist and specialist phenotype. A concave

              mass of normal cells would be highly heterogeneous as a result of
              the mutations that occur during each cell division. What is
              remarkable about cancers is that virtually every neoplastic cell
              within a large tumour often contains the same core set of genetic
              alterations, with heterogeneity confined to mutations that emerge
              late during tumour growth. How such alterations expand within the

              Significant spatial, intra- and intertumoral heterogeneities were
              observed at the cellular level. In the patient 1, all cells
              shared the same TP53 driver mutation, implying a monoclonal
              origin of PCa. In the patient 2, only a subpopulation of cells
              contained the TP53 driver mutation, whereas other cells carried
              different driver mutations, indicating a typical polyclonal model
              with separate clonal cell expansions. The tumor cells from
              different sides of prostate owned various mutation patterns.
              Considerable neoantigens were predicted among different cells,
              implying unknown immune editing components helping prostate tumor
              cells escaping from immune surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: There is a
              significant spatial genomic heterogeneity even in the same PCa
              patient. Our study also provides the first genome-wide evidence
              at single-cell level, supporting that the origin of PCa could be
              either polyclonal or monoclonal, which has implications for
              treatment decisions for prostate cancer. PATIENT SUMMARY: We
              reported the first single-cell whole genomic data of prostate
              adenocarcinoma (PCa) from different Gleason scores.
              Identification of these genetic alterations may help understand
              PCa tumor progression and clonal evolution.",

              chromosomal instability results in pervasive SCNA heterogeneity.
              Parallel evolutionary events, which cause disruption in the same
              genes (such as BCL9, MCL1, ARNT (also known as HIF1B), TERT and
              MYC) within separate subclones, were present in 37\% of tumours.
              Most recurrent losses probably occurred before whole-genome
              doubling, that was found as a clonal event in 49\% of tumours.
              However, loss of heterozygosity at the human leukocyte antigen

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Intratumor heterogeneity may foster tumor evolution
              and adaptation and hinder personalized-medicine strategies that
              depend on results from single tumor-biopsy samples. METHODS: To
              examine intratumor heterogeneity, we performed exome sequencing,
              chromosome aberration analysis, and ploidy profiling on multiple
              spatially separated samples obtained from primary renal
              carcinomas and associated metastatic sites. We characterized the
              consequences of intratumor heterogeneity using
              immunohistochemical analysis, mutation functional analysis, and
              profiling of messenger RNA expression. RESULTS: Phylogenetic
              reconstruction revealed branched evolutionary tumor growth, with
              63 to 69\% of all somatic mutations not detectable across every
              tumor region. Intratumor heterogeneity was observed for a
              mutation within an autoinhibitory domain of the mammalian target
              of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, correlating with S6 and 4EBP
              phosphorylation in vivo and constitutive activation of mTOR
              kinase activity in vitro. Mutational intratumor heterogeneity was
              seen for multiple tumor-suppressor genes converging on loss of
              function; SETD2, PTEN, and KDM5C underwent multiple distinct and
              spatially separated inactivating mutations within a single tumor,
              suggesting convergent phenotypic evolution. Gene-expression
              signatures of good and poor prognosis were detected in different
              regions of the same tumor. Allelic composition and ploidy
              profiling analysis revealed extensive intratumor heterogeneity,
              with 26 of 30 tumor samples from four tumors harboring divergent
              allelic-imbalance profiles and with ploidy heterogeneity in two
              of four tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Intratumor heterogeneity can lead to
              underestimation of the tumor genomics landscape portrayed from
              single tumor-biopsy samples and may present major challenges to
              personalized-medicine and biomarker development. Intratumor
              heterogeneity, associated with heterogeneous protein function,
              may foster tumor adaptation and therapeutic failure through
              Darwinian selection. (Funded by the Medical Research Council and

              not routinely sample patients at multiple stages of their

              opportunity to study human tumor progression because they still
              contain evidence of early and intermediate subpopulations in the
              form of the phylogenetic relationships. We have developed a
              method we call Sector-Ploidy-Profiling (SPP) to study the clonal
              composition of breast tumors. SPP involves macro-dissecting
              tumors, flow-sorting genomic subpopulations by DNA content, and
              profiling genomes using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).
              Breast carcinomas display two classes of genomic structural
              variation: (1) monogenomic and (2) polygenomic. Monogenomic
              tumors appear to contain a single major clonal subpopulation with
              a highly stable chromosome structure. Polygenomic tumors contain
              multiple clonal tumor subpopulations, which may occupy the same
              sectors, or separate anatomic locations. In polygenomic tumors,
              we show that heterogeneity can be ascribed to a few clonal
              subpopulations, rather than a series of gradual intermediates. By
              comparing multiple subpopulations from different anatomic
              locations, we have inferred pathways of cancer progression and

              Although mutations in known driver genes typically occurred early
              in cancer evolution, we also identified later subclonal

              PIK3CA (E545K), EGFR (L858R), and KRAS (G12D), which may

              by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which
              mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance.
              Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome
              studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively
              significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons
              into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such
              as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein
              titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that
              overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems
              largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel
              analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We

              the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication
              timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating
              mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to

              in many scRNA-seq analysis pipelines is the annotation of cells
              into known cell types. While this can be achieved using
              experimental techniques, such as fluorescence-activated cell
              sorting, these approaches are impractical for large numbers of
              cells. This motivates the development of data-driven cell-type

               (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state
               space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and
               spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and
               geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate
               Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive
               regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent
               field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with
               non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not
               available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response
               variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can
               be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of
               both convergence and computational time. In some practical
               applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov
               chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for
               routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested

               directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior
               marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is
               computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need
               hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise
               estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our
               approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform
               Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to
               compute model comparison criteria and various predictive

                   and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes
                   of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and
                   within a machine across multiple computational devices,
                   including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom
                   designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This

                   whereas in previous ``parameter server'' designs the
                   management of shared state is built into the system,

              systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of
              edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a
              lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy
              function in the physical system determines its Gibbs
              distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random
              field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF
              image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural
              mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local
              characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation
              mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and
              multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is
              an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy,
              the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical
              system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system
              isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same
              thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The
              analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the
              maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the
              degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel
              ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish
              convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with

              intratumor heterogeneity, without any obvious morphological and
              pathological steps to define sequential evolution, and its
              progression may vary among individual tumors. In an attempt to
              elucidate these etiological and phenotypic complexities, the
              present study, based on the fundamental concept that genomic
              instability is the engine of both tumor progression and tumor
              heterogeneity, was conducted to test the hypothesis that breast
              cancer pathogenesis is driven by double-strand break
              (DSB)-initiated chromosome instability (CIN). The rationale
              underlying this hypothesis is derived from the clues provided by
              family breast cancer syndromes, in which susceptibility genes,
              including p53, ATM, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are involved within the
              common functional pathway of DSB-related checkpoint/ repair.
              Because genomic deletion caused by DSB is reflected in the
              genetic mechanism of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), this
              genome-wide LOH study was conducted, using 100 tumors and 400
              microsatellite markers. To minimize the effect of heterogeneity
              within tumors, the experimental technique of laser capture
              microdissection was used to ensure that genetic and phenotypic
              examinations were based on the same tumor cells. Support for our
              hypothesis comes from the observations that: (a) the extent of
              DSB-initiated CIN in tumors significantly increased as tumors
              progressed to poorer grades or later stages; (b) in the
              sequential steps toward CIN, the loci of p53 and ATM, the key
              checkpoint genes against DSB, were lost at the earliest stage;
              and (c) many loci identified to be important in breast
              tumorigenesis were the genomic sites possibly harboring the genes
              involved in DSB-related checkpoint/repair (including RAD51,
              RAD52, and BRCA1) or CIN (including FA-A, FA-D, and WRN), and a
              higher number of these loci showing LOH was significantly
              associated with increased level of DSB-initiated CIN (P <
              0.0001). Breast cancers are thus considered to be sequentially
              progressive with CIN. However, CIN might also cause genetic
              heterogeneity, which was revealed by the findings that LOH at
              some markers was observed only in the component of ductal
              carcinoma in situ but not in the invasive component of the same
              tumors. In addition, some markers were found to preferentially
              lose at specific tumor grades, implying their contribution to
              genetic heterogeneity during tumor development. Therefore, this
              study suggests that breast cancer progression is clonal with
              regard to CIN, but different breast cancers would present
              distinct molecular profiles resulting from genetic heterogeneity
              caused by CIN.",

              progression of many cancers through the alterations of their gene
              expression levels on individual or several cancer types. However,
              it is not quite clear whether the correlation will be a general
              phenomenon across multiple cancer types. METHODS: In this study
              we applied a bioinformatics approach integrating CNV and
              differential gene expression mathematically across 1025 cell
              lines and 9159 patient samples to detect their potential
              relationship. RESULTS: Our results showed there is a close
              correlation between CNV and differential gene expression and the
              copy number displayed a positive linear influence on gene
              expression for the majority of genes, indicating that genetic
              variation generated a direct effect on gene transcriptional

              relationship between copy number and expression level. Further

              gene expression are clustered in certain disease-related
              pathways, which suggests the involvement of CNV in

              trends in the United States. METHODS: Data on new cancer
              diagnoses during 2001-2018 were obtained from the North American
              Association of Central Cancer Registries' Cancer in North America
              Incidence file, which is comprised of data from Centers for
              Disease Control and Prevention-funded and National Cancer
              Institute-funded, population-based cancer registry programs. Data
              on cancer deaths during 2001-2019 were obtained from the National
              Center for Health Statistics' National Vital Statistics System.
              Five-year average incidence and death rates along with trends for
              all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types are
              reported by sex, racial/ethnic group, and age. RESULTS: Overall
              cancer incidence rates were 497 per 100,000 among males (ranging
              from 306 among Asian/Pacific Islander males to 544 among Black
              males) and 431 per 100,000 among females (ranging from 309 among
              Asian/Pacific Islander females to 473 among American
              Indian/Alaska Native females) during 2014-2018. The trend during
              the corresponding period was stable among males and increased
              0.2\% on average per year among females, with differing trends by
              sex, racial/ethnic group, and cancer type. Among males, incidence
              rates increased for three cancers (including pancreas and
              kidney), were stable for seven cancers (including prostate), and
              decreased for eight (including lung and larynx) of the 18 most
              common cancers considered in this analysis. Among females,
              incidence rates increased for seven cancers (including melanoma,
              liver, and breast), were stable for four cancers (including
              uterus), and decreased for seven (including thyroid and ovary) of
              the 18 most common cancers. Overall cancer death rates decreased
              by 2.3\% per year among males and by 1.9\% per year among females
              during 2015-2019, with the sex-specific declining trend reflected
              in every major racial/ethnic group. During 2015-2019, death rates
              decreased for 11 of the 19 most common cancers among males and
              for 14 of the 20 most common cancers among females, with the
              steepest declines (>4\% per year) reported for lung cancer and
              melanoma. Five-year survival for adenocarcinoma and
              neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer improved between 2001 and 2018;
              however, overall incidence (2001-2018) and mortality (2001-2019)
              continued to increase for this site. Among children (younger than
              15 years), recent trends were stable for incidence and decreased
              for mortality; and among, adolescents and young adults (aged
              15-39 years), recent trends increased for incidence and declined
              for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer death rates continued to
              decline overall, for children, and for adolescents and young
              adults, and treatment advances have led to accelerated declines
              in death rates for several sites, such as lung and melanoma. The
              increases in incidence rates for several common cancers in part
              reflect changes in risk factors, screening test use, and
              diagnostic practice. Racial/ethnic differences exist in cancer
              incidence and mortality, highlighting the need to understand and
              address inequities. Population-based incidence and mortality data
              inform prevention, early detection, and treatment efforts to help
              reduce the cancer burden in the United States.",

              million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin
              cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung
              cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated
              2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%),
              colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%)
              cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death,

              colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female
              breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to

              both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little

              metastases is considered incurable with currently available

              breast cancer is multidisciplinary; it includes locoregional
              (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy approaches.
              Systemic therapies include endocrine therapy for hormone

              and prostate has been known for a long time, but there are
              serious discrepancies in the terminology describing breast and
              prostate cancers. The use of the large, thick-section (3D)
              histology technique for both organs exposes the irrationality of
              the breast cancer terminology. Pathologists with expertise in
              diagnosing prostate cancer take the anatomic site of cancer
              origin into account when using the terms AAP (acinar
              adenocarcinoma of the prostate) and DAP (ductal adenocarcinoma of
              the prostate) to distinguish between the prostate cancers
              originating primarily from the fluid-producing acinar portion of
              the organ (AAP) and the tumors originating either purely from the
              larger ducts (DAP) or from both the acini and the main ducts
              combined (DAP and AAP). Long-term patient outcome is closely
              correlated with the terminology, because patients with DAP have a
              significantly poorer prognosis than patients with AAP. The
              current breast cancer terminology could be improved by modeling
              it after the method of classifying prostate cancer to reflect the
              anatomic site of breast cancer origin and the patient outcome.
              The long-term survival curves of our consecutive breast cancer
              cases collected since 1977 clearly show that the non-palpable,
              screen-detected breast cancers originating from the
              milk-producing acini have excellent prognosis, irrespective of
              their histologic malignancy grade or biomarkers. Correspondingly,
              the breast cancer subtypes of truly ductal origin have a
              significantly poorer outcome, despite recent improvements in
              diagnosis and therapy. The mammographic appearance of breast
              cancers reflects the underlying tissue structure. Addition of
              these ``mammographic tumor features'' to the currently used
              histologic phenotypes makes it possible to distinguish the breast
              cancer cases of ductal origin with a poor outcome, termed DAB
              (ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast), from the more easily
              managed breast cancers of acinar origin, termed AAB (acinar
              adenocarcinoma of the breast), which have a significantly better
              outcome. This simple and easily communicable terminology could
              lead to better communication between the diagnostic and
              therapeutic team members and result in more rational treatment
              planning for the benefit of their patients.",

              to identify and investigate breast cancers originating from the
              terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs) of the breast in order to
              overcome the confusion arising from the current histopathology
              terminology, which calls cancers arising from the TDLUs either
              ``ductal'' or ``lobular''. METHOD: Prospectively collected data
              from a randomized controlled mammography screening trial with
              more than four decades of follow up, and data from the subsequent
              population-based service screening program in Dalarna County,
              Sweden, provided the database necessary for studying nonpalpable,
              primarily screen-detected breast cancer cases in their earliest
              detectable phases. Large format thick (subgross) and thin section
              histopathologic images of breast cancers originating from the
              TDLUs were correlated with their mammographic tumour features
              (imaging biomarkers) and long-term patient outcome. RESULTS: This
              systematic correlation indicates that imaging biomarkers can
              reliably determine the site of origin of breast cancers arising
              from the terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs). This breast
              cancer subgroup has four specific mammographic tumour features:
              the in situ carcinomas developing from the TDLUs appear as
              powdery or crushed stone-like calcifications, while the invasive
              carcinomas appear as stellate/spiculated or circular/oval shaped
              tumour masses. These features are easily identified with breast
              imaging, either alone or in combination, unifocal or multifocal.
              We propose calling breast cancers of TDLU origin acinar
              adenocarcinoma of the breast (AAB). CONCLUSIONS: The era of early
              detection necessitates rectifying the current, confusing
              histopathological nomenclature to one that is based on the
              anatomical site of origin of breast cancers. Invasive cancers
              originating from the TDLUs are either stellate/spiculated or
              circular, irrespective of the complex WHO histopathologic
              terminology. The mortality reduction accomplished by
              participation in mammography screening is mostly accomplished by
              identifying and treating the AABs in their non-palpable, early
              phase. AABs detected when < 15 mm diameter with no associated
              carcinoma originating from the major lactiferous ducts (ductal
              adenocarcinoma of the breast, DAB) have a good to excellent
              long-term outcome, irrespective of the current terminology, which
              tends to lead to overtreatment of these early invasive tumours.
              The conventionally used prognostic factors, including
              immunohistochemical biomarkers, fail to identify those 1-14 mm
              invasive AABs tumours that are eventually fatal. This
              identification can be made preoperatively by including the
              characteristic mammographic tumour features, imaging biomarkers,
              in primary diagnosis, treatment planning, and predicting
              long-term patient outcome. Forthcoming articles will address
              breast malignancies originating from structures of the breast
              other than the TDLUs.",

              centrally checked on mortality and recurrence for each woman in
              any randomised trial that began before 1985 of any aspect of
              systemic adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer. Checked data
              were available for 75 000 women (about 90\% of those ever
              randomised), of whom 32\% had died and another 10\% had
              experienced recurrence. The parts now reviewed include 30 000
              women in tamoxifen trials, 3000 in ovarian ablation trials, 11
              000 in polychemotherapy trials, 15 000 in other chemotherapy
              comparisons, and 6000 in immunotherapy trials. Highly significant
              reductions in the annual rates both of recurrence and of death
              are produced by tamoxifen (25\% SD 2 recurrence and 17\% SD 2
              mortality: 2p<0·00001), by ablation below age 50 (26\% SD 6
              recurrence and 25\% SD 7 mortality: 2p=0·0004), and by
              polychemotherapy (28\% SD 3 recurrence and 16\% SD 3 mortality:
              2p<0·00001), but not by ablation at older ages or by
              immunotherapy. (Tamoxifen also reduced the risk of development of
              contralateral breast cancer by 39\% SD 9: 1p<0·00001.) For
              tamoxifen and for polychemotherapy the avoidance of recurrence is
              chiefly during years 0-4 (this difference being maintained but
              not increased afterwards), but the avoidance of mortality is
              highly significant both during and after years 0-4, so the
              cumulative differences in survival produced by these relatively
              brief treatments (median: 2 years tamoxifen, 1 year
              polychemotherapy) are larger at 10 than at 5 years. There is
              little information beyond year 10 (except for ovarian ablation,
              which produces separately significant mortality reductions both
              during and after years 0-9). Both direct and indirect randomised
              comparisons show long-term polychemotherapy (eg, 12 months) to be
              no better than shorter (eg, 6 months) regimens, but do show
              polychemotherapy to be significantly better than single-agent
              chemotherapy. Indirect randomised comparisons do not reveal
              significant differences between different forms of
              polychemotherapy, or differences between different tamoxifen
              doses, but do show that long-term tamoxifen (eg, 2 years, or even
              5 years) is significantly more effective than shorter tamoxifen
              regimens. In old age (70+) tamoxifen is of demonstrated efficacy,
              but chemotherapy has not been evaluated. Between ages 50 and 69
              direct comparisons show that chemotherapy plus tamoxifen is
              better (1p<0·00001) than chemotherapy alone both for recurrence
              and for mortality, and better (1 p<0·00001) than tamoxifen alone
              for recurrence. In women aged under 50 chemotherapy and ovarian
              ablation appear, by an indirect comparison, to be of comparable
              efficacy, and the combination may be still better. The 30-40\%
              proportional risk reductions that can be produced by combined
              chemo-endocrine therapy in middle age are similar for
              node-positive and for node-negative patients, but the absolute
              improvement in 10-year survival is about twice as great for the
              former (at least 12 deaths avoided per 100 women treated) as for

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The four intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, defined
              by differential expression of 50 genes (PAM50), have been shown
              to be predictive of risk of recurrence and benefit of hormonal
              therapy and chemotherapy. Here we describe the development of
              Prosigna™, a PAM50-based subtype classifier and risk model on the
              NanoString nCounter Dx Analysis System intended for decentralized
              testing in clinical laboratories. METHODS: 514 formalin-fixed,
              paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer patient samples were used
              to train prototypical centroids for each of the intrinsic
              subtypes of breast cancer on the NanoString platform.
              Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression data was used to
              identify the prototypical centroids defined in previous PAM50
              algorithm training exercises. 304 FFPE patient samples from a
              well annotated clinical cohort in the absence of adjuvant
              systemic therapy were then used to train a subtype-based risk
              model (i.e. Prosigna ROR score). 232 samples from a
              tamoxifen-treated patient cohort were used to verify the
              prognostic accuracy of the algorithm prior to initiating clinical
              validation studies. RESULTS: The gene expression profiles of each
              of the four Prosigna subtype centroids were consistent with those
              previously published using the PCR-based PAM50 method. Similar to
              previously published classifiers, tumor samples classified as
              Luminal A by Prosigna had the best prognosis compared to samples
              classified as one of the three higher-risk tumor subtypes. The
              Prosigna Risk of Recurrence (ROR) score model was verified to be
              significantly associated with prognosis as a continuous variable
              and to add significant information over both commonly available
              IHC markers and Adjuvant! Online. CONCLUSIONS: The results from
              the training and verification data sets show that the FDA-cleared
              and CE marked Prosigna test provides an accurate estimate of the
              risk of distant recurrence in hormone receptor positive breast
              cancer and is also capable of identifying a tumor's intrinsic
              subtype that is consistent with the previously published
              PCR-based PAM50 assay. Subsequent analytical and clinical
              validation studies confirm the clinical accuracy and technical
              precision of the Prosigna PAM50 assay in a decentralized setting.",

              retaining essentially unchanged recommendations for the systemic
              adjuvant therapy of HER2-positive and 'triple-negative' disease.
              The Panel again accepted that conventional clinico-pathological
              factors provided a surrogate subtype classification, while noting
              that in those areas of the world where multi-gene molecular
              assays are readily available many clinicians prefer to base
              chemotherapy decisions for patients with luminal disease on these
              genomic results rather than the surrogate subtype definitions.
              Several multi-gene molecular assays were recognized as providing
              accurate and reproducible prognostic information, and in some
              cases prediction of response to chemotherapy. Cost and
              availability preclude their application in many environments at
              the present time. Broad treatment recommendations are presented.
              Such recommendations do not imply that each Panel member agrees:
              indeed, among more than 100 questions, only one (trastuzumab
              duration) commanded 100\% agreement. The various recommendations
              in fact carried differing degrees of support, as reflected in the

              mammary tissue using a combination of flow cytometry and in vitro
              colony assay procedures. Three types of human breast epithelial
              cell (HBEC) progenitors were identified: luminal-restricted,
              myoepithelial-restricted and bipotent progenitors. The first type
              expressed epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), alpha6
              integrin and MUC1 and generated colonies composed exclusively of
              cells positive for the luminal-associated markers keratin 8/18,
              keratin 19, EpCAM and MUC1. Bipotent progenitors produced
              colonies containing a central core of cells expressing luminal
              markers surrounded by keratin 14+ myoepithelial-like cells.
              Single cell cultures confirmed the bipotentiality of these

              first transpires in the embryo as the ectoderm forms a mammary
              line that resolves into placodes. Regulated by
              epithelial--mesenchymal interactions, the placodes descend into
              the underlying mesenchyme and produce the rudimentary ductal
              structure of the gland present at birth. Subsequent stages of
              development---pubertal growth, pregnancy, lactation, and
              involution---occur postnatally under the regulation of hormones.
              Puberty initiates branching morphogenesis, which requires growth
              hormone (GH) and estrogen, as well as insulin-like growth factor
              1 (IGF1), to create a ductal tree that fills the fat pad. Upon
              pregnancy, the combined actions of progesterone and prolactin
              generate alveoli, which secrete milk during lactation. Lack of
              demand for milk at weaning initiates the process of involution
              whereby the gland is remodeled back to its prepregnancy state.
              These processes require numerous signaling pathways that have
              distinct regulatory functions at different stages of gland
              development. Signaling pathways also regulate a specialized
              subpopulation of mammary stem cells that fuel the dramatic
              changes in the gland occurring with each pregnancy. Our knowledge
              of mammary gland development and mammary stem cell biology has
              significantly contributed to our understanding of breast cancer

              Two models have been proposed to explain the cell of origin of

              representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely
              in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the
              basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC.
              Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic
              mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes,
              in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with
              founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and
              motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies,
              suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression.
              Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology
              and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the
              determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.",

  abstract = "HER2-positive breast cancer has long proven to be a clinically
              distinct class of breast cancers for which several targeted
              therapies are now available. However, resistance to the treatment
              associated with specific gene expressions or mutations has been
              observed, revealing the underlying diversity of these cancers.
              Therefore, understanding the full extent of the HER2-positive
              disease heterogeneity still remains challenging. Here we carry
              out an in-depth genomic characterization of 64 HER2-positive
              breast tumour genomes that exhibit four subgroups, based on the
              expression data, with distinctive genomic features in terms of
              somatic mutations, copy-number changes or structural variations.
              The results suggest that, despite being clinically defined by a
              specific gene amplification, HER2-positive tumours melt into the
              whole luminal-basal breast cancer spectrum rather than standing
              apart. The results also lead to a refined ERBB2 amplicon of 106

              events take place in what order, before one or more of these
              clones in normal tissues ultimately evolve to cancer. Here, using
              phylogenetic analyses of multiple microdissected samples from
              both cancer and non-cancer lesions, we show unique evolutionary
              histories of breast cancers harbouring der(1;16), a common driver
              alteration found in roughly 20\% of breast cancers. The
              approximate timing of early evolutionary events was estimated
              from the mutation rate measured in normal epithelial cells. In
              der(1;16)(+) cancers, the derivative chromosome was acquired from
              early puberty to late adolescence, followed by the emergence of a
              common ancestor by the patient's early 30s, from which both
              cancer and non-cancer clones evolved. Replacing the pre-existing
              mammary epithelium in the following years, these clones occupied
              a large area within the premenopausal breast tissues by the time
              of cancer diagnosis. Evolution of multiple independent cancer
              founders from the non-cancer ancestors was common, contributing
              to intratumour heterogeneity. The number of driver events did not
              correlate with histology, suggesting the role of local
              microenvironments and/or epigenetic driver events. A similar

              inherently immunogenic and insufficiently represented by immune
              cell infiltrates. Therefore, for a long time, it was thought that
              the immunotherapies targeting this type of cancer and its
              microenvironment were not justified and would not bring benefits
              for breast cancer patients. Nevertheless, to date, a considerable
              number of reports have indicated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
              (TILs) as a prognostic and clinically relevant biomarker in
              breast cancer. A high TILs expression has been demonstrated in
              primary tumors, of both, HER2-positive BC and triple-negative
              (TNBC), of patients before treatment, as well as after treatment
              with adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Another milestone was
              reached in advanced TNBC immunotherapy with the help of the
              immune checkpoint inhibitors directed against the PD-L1 molecule.
              Although those findings, together with the recent developments in
              chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies, show immense promise

              primary tumors and metastatic lesions from 99 samples obtained
              from 20 patients with breast cancer. Our evolutionary analyses
              revealed diverse spreading and seeding patterns that govern tumor
              progression. Although linear evolution to successive metastatic
              sites was common, parallel evolution from the primary tumor to
              multiple distant sites was also evident. Metastatic spreading was
              frequently coupled with polyclonal seeding, in which multiple
              metastatic subclones originated from the primary tumor and/or
              other distant metastases. Synchronous ALN metastasis, a
              well-established prognosticator of breast cancer, was not
              involved in seeding the distant metastasis, suggesting a
              hematogenous route for cancer dissemination. Clonal evolution
              coincided frequently with emerging driver alterations and

               processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been
               exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated
               catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied
               mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the
               underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and
               double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible.
               Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic
               combination of substitution mutation signatures and a
               distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between
               somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A
               remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed
               ``kataegis,'' was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between
               cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements.
               Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of
               cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of

              IHC, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)

              We matched concordant tumor as luminal A and HR+/HER2-, luminal B

              were discordant between IHC-based subtype and PAM50 intrinsic
              subtype. Using targeted sequencing, we detected somatic
              mutation-related discordant breast cancer including the VHL gene
              in the HR+/HER2- group (31\% in concordant group, 0\% in

              12\%, p=0.02 and 0\% vs. 25\%, p=0.02, respectively) in the TNBC

              had significantly worse OS (median OS, 73.6 months vs. not
              reached; p < 0.001), and among the patients with HR positivity,
              the basal-like group as determined by PAM50 showed significantly

              remains elusive. Here, we use single-cell mRNA sequencing
              (scRNAseq) to profile the transcriptomes of 25,790 primary human
              breast epithelial cells isolated from reduction mammoplasties of
              seven individuals. Unbiased clustering analysis reveals the
              existence of three distinct epithelial cell populations, one
              basal and two luminal cell types, which we identify as secretory
              L1- and hormone-responsive L2-type cells. Pseudotemporal
              reconstruction of differentiation trajectories produces one
              continuous lineage hierarchy that closely connects the basal
              lineage to the two differentiated luminal branches. Our
              comprehensive cell atlas provides insights into the cellular
              blueprint of the human breast epithelium and will form the

              myoepithelial cells. DCIS is a non-obligate precursor of invasive
              breast cancer, and up to 40\% of these lesions progress to
              invasive disease if untreated. Currently, it is not possible to

              from 68 100 micro m serial sections. The mastectomy nipples

              39 women with a diagnosis of DCIS in retrospect had
              calcifications visible on both their current and prior
              examinations; these formed the study group. For individual

              to the nipple at 2.6 mm y(-1). Increase in calcifications along
              the axis to the nipple occurred at 2.6 mm y(-1)toward and 2.8 mm

              occurred at 1.8 mm y(-1)for low grade, 4.2 mm y(-1)for
              intermediate grade and 7.1 mm y(-1)for high grade. DCIS growth

              the prespecified DCIS risk groups of low, intermediate, and high,
              the 10-year risks of developing an IBE were 10.6\%, 26.7\%, and

              CD24 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 747
              breast cancer tissues, and DNA methylation and histone
              modification status in the promoter region of CD24 were assessed

              overexpression was significantly correlated with the presence of

              Patients with CD24-high tumours had significantly shorter patient

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin V has
              previously been shown to exhibit elevated expression in breast
              cancer tissue and be associated with distant metastasis. Research
              has also identified that cathepsin V expression is elevated in
              tumour tissues from numerous other malignancies, but despite
              this, there has been limited examination of the function of this
              protease in cancer. Here we investigate the role of cathepsin V
              in breast cancer in order to delineate the molecular mechanisms
              by which this protease contributes to tumourigenesis. METHODS:
              Lentiviral transductions were used to generate shRNA cell line
              models, with cell line validation undertaken using RQ-PCR and
              Western blotting. Phenotypic changes of tumour cell biology were
              examined using clonogenic and invasion assays. The relationship
              between GATA3 expression and cathepsin V was primarily analysed
              using Western blotting. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to
              generate catalytic mutant and shRNA-resistant constructs to
              confirm the role of cathepsin V in regulating GATA3 expression.
              RESULTS: We have identified that elevated cathepsin V expression
              is associated with reduced survival in ER-positive breast
              cancers. Cathepsin V regulates the expression of GATA3 in
              ER-positive breast cancers, through promoting its degradation via
              the proteasome. We have determined that depletion of cathepsin V
              results in elevated pAkt-1 and reduced GSK-3$\beta$ expression,
              which rescues GATA3 from proteasomal degradation. CONCLUSIONS: In
              this study, we have identified that cysteine protease cathepsin V
              can suppress GATA3 expression in ER-positive breast cancers by
              facilitating its turnover via the proteasome. Therefore,
              targeting cathepsin V may represent a potential therapeutic
              strategy in ER-positive breast cancers, by restoring GATA3

  abstract = "An orthotopic mouse model of cervical carcinoma has been used to
              investigate the relationship between acute (cyclic) hypoxia and
              spontaneous lymph node metastasis in vivo. The human cervical
              carcinoma cell line ME-180 was stably transfected to express the
              fluorescent protein DsRed2, which allowed the in vivo optical
              monitoring of tumor growth and metastasis by fluorescent
              microscopy. The surgically implanted primary tumors metastasize
              initially to local lymph nodes and later to lung, a pattern
              consistent with the clinical course of the disease. The effect of
              acute hypoxia on the growth and spread of these tumors was
              examined by exposing tumor-bearing mice to treatment consisting
              of exposure to 12 cycles of 10 min 7\% O(2) followed by 10 min
              air (total 4 h) daily during tumor growth. After 21 days, the
              tumors were excised, lymph node and lung metastases were
              quantified, and the hypoxic fraction and relative vascular area
              of the primary tumors were assessed by immunohistochemical
              staining for the hypoxic marker drug EF5
              [2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazole-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)
              acetamide] and the vascular marker CD31, respectively. In
              untreated mice, the primary tumor size was directly correlated
              with lymph node metastatic burden. The acute hypoxia treatment
              resulted in a significant decrease in the size of the primary
              tumors at the time of excision. However, the mice in the acute
              hypoxia group had an increased number of positive lymph nodes
              (2-4) as compared with control mice (1-3). Lung metastasis was
              not affected. The acute hypoxia treatment also decreased the
              relative vascular area in the primary tumors but did not affect
              the hypoxic fraction. These results suggest that fluctuating
              oxygenation in cervical carcinoma tumors may reduce tumor growth
              rate, but it may also enhance the ability of tumor cells to
              metastasize to local lymph nodes.",

  author    = "Dobzhansky, Theodosius",
  abstract  = "As RECENTLY AS 1966, sheik Abd el Aziz bin Baz asked the king of
               Saudi Arabia to suppress a heresy that was spreading in his
               land. Wrote the sheik: ``The Holy Koran, the Prophet's
               teachings, the majority of Islamic scientists, and the actual
               facts all prove that the sun is running in its orbit ... and
               that the earth is fixed and stable, spread out by God for his
               mankind. ... Anyone who professed otherwise would utter a charge
               of falsehood toward God, the Koran, and the Prophet.'' The good
               sheik evidently holds the Copernican theory to be a ``mere
               theory,'' not a ``fact.'' In this he is technically correct. A
               theory can be verified by a mass of facts, but it becomes a
               proven theory, not a fact. The sheik was perhaps unaware that
               the Space Age had begun before he asked the king to suppress the
               Copernican heresy. The sphericity of the earth had been seen by
               astronauts, and even by many earth-bound people on their
               television screens. Perhaps the sheik could retort that those
               who venture beyond the confines of God's earth suffer
               hallucinations, and that the earth is really flat. Parts of the
               Copernican world model, such as the contention that the earth
               rotates around the sun, and not vice versa, have not been
               verified by direct observations even to the extent the
               sphericity of the earth has been. Yet scientists accept the
               model as an accurate representation of reality. Why? Because it
               makes sense of a multitude of facts which are otherwise
               meaningless or extravagant. To nonspecialists most of these
               facts are unfamiliar. Why then do we accept the ``mere theory''
               that the earth is a sphere revolving around a spherical sun? Are
               we simply submitting to authority? Not quite: we know that those
               who took time to study the evidence found it convincing. The
               good sheik is probably ignorant of the evidence. Even more
               likely, he is so hopelessly biased that no amount of evidence
               would impress him. Anyway, it would be sheer waste of time to
               attempt to convince him. The Koran and the Bible do not
               contradict Copernicus, nor does Copernicus contradict them. It
               is ludicrous to mistake the Bible and the Koran for primers of
               natural science. They treat of matters even more important: the
               meaning of man and his relations to God. They are written in
               poetic symbols that were understandable to people of the age
               when they were written, as well as to peoples of all other ages.
               The king of Arabia did not comply with the sheik's demand. He
               knew that some people fear enlightenment, because enlightenment
               threatens their vested interests. Education is not to be used to
               promote obscurantism. The earth is not the geometric center of
               the universe, although it may be its spiritual center. It is a
               mere speck of dust in cosmic spaces. Contrary to Bishop Ussher's
               calculations, the world did not appear in approximately its
               present state in 4004 B.C. The estimates of the age of the
               universe given by modern cosmologists are still only rough
               approximations, which are revised (usually upward) as the
               methods of estimation are refined. Some cosmologists take the
               universe to be about 10 billion years old; others suppose that
               it may have existed, and will continue to exist, eternally. The
               origin of life on earth is dated tentatively between 3 and 5
               billion years ago; manlike beings appeared relatively quite
               recently, between 2 and 4 million years ago. The estimates of
               the age of the earth, of the duration of the geologic and
               paleontologic eras, and of the antiquity of man's ancestors are
               now based mainly on radiometric evidence-the proportions of

              diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. New
              classifications of DCIS recently have been proposed. In this
              study, these classifications were applied to DCIS associated with
              invasive tumors and correlated with patient prognosis. METHODS:
              Three hundred cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the
              breast in which there was associated DCIS in the surrounding
              breast were studied. The DCIS was classified as well, moderately,
              or poorly differentiated, according to two recently published
              systems using the cytonuclear features of the malignant cells
              (Holland classification) and cytology and the presence of
              necrosis (Van Nuys classification). RESULTS: The differentiation
              of DCIS was significantly correlated with the grade of the
              invasive carcinoma (P < 0.0001), the Nottingham prognostic index
              (P < 0.0001), and the clinical outcomes of the patients (P <
              0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a model in
              which there is increasing in situ dysplasia before the
              development of stromal invasion is incorrect for breast
              carcinoma. Rather, in most cases, well-differentiated DCIS
              probably gives rise to low grade invasive breast carcinoma with a
              better long term clinical outcome. These data suggest that many
              of the important prognostic biologic and genetic characteristics
              of breast carcinoma are already established in the neoplastic

              women screened in the mass screening programme, and women not
              screened in the mass screening programme, and to estimate the
              amount of overdiagnosis by grade of DCIS. We retrospectively
              included a population-based sample of 4232 women with a diagnosis
              of DCIS in the years 2007-2009 from the Nationwide network and
              registry of histopathology and cytopathology in the Netherlands.
              Excluded were women with concurrent invasive breast cancer,
              lobular carcinoma in situ and no DCIS, women recently treated for
              invasive breast cancer, no grade mentioned in the record,
              inconclusive record on invasion, and prevalent DCIS. The
              screening status was obtained via the screening organisations.
              The distribution of grades was incorporated in the
              well-established and validated microsimulation model MISCAN.
              RESULTS: Overall, 17.7 \% of DCIS were low grade, 31.4 \%
              intermediate grade, and 50.9 \% high grade. This distribution did
              not differ by screening status, but did vary by age. Older women
              were more likely to have low-grade DCIS than younger women.
              Overdiagnosis as a proportion of all cancers in women of the
              screening age was 61 \% for low-grade, 57 \% for
              intermediate-grade, 45 \% for high-grade DCIS. For women age
              50-60 years with a high-grade DCIS this overdiagnosis rate was
              21-29 \%, compared to 50-66 \% in women age 60-75 years with
              high-grade DCIS. CONCLUSIONS: Amongst the rapidly increasing
              numbers of DCIS diagnosed each year is a significant number of

              progression is the next step to preventing overtreatment. The

              common epithelial progenitor or stem cell located at the terminal
              duct lobular units (TDLUs), BC shows a broad spectrum of
              morphology with extensive variation in histological type and
              grade. This is related to the complexity of BC carcinogenesis
              including initial genetic changes in the cell of origin,
              subsequent genetic and epigenetic alterations and reprogramming
              that occur at various stages of BC development and the interplay
              with the surrounding microenvironment, factors which influence
              the process of differentiation. Differentiation in BC determines
              the morphology, which can be measured using histological grade
              and tumour type. Histological grade, which measures the
              similarity to the TDLUs, reflects the degree of differentiation

              cancer on recurrence and 15-year survival: an overview of the
              randomised trials",
  author   = "{Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG)}",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Quinquennial overviews (1985-2000) of the randomised
              trials in early breast cancer have assessed the 5 year and
              10-year effects of various systemic adjuvant therapies on breast
              cancer recurrence and survival. Here, we report the 10-year and
              15-year effects. METHODS: Collaborative meta-analyses were
              undertaken of 194 unconfounded randomised trials of adjuvant
              chemotherapy or hormonal therapy that began by 1995. Many trials
              involved CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil),
              anthracycline-based combinations such as FAC (fluorouracil,
              doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin,
              cyclophosphamide), tamoxifen, or ovarian suppression: none
              involved taxanes, trastuzumab, raloxifene, or modern aromatase
              inhibitors. FINDINGS: Allocation to about 6 months of
              anthracycline-based polychemotherapy (eg, with FAC or FEC)
              reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by about 38\% (SE 5)
              for women younger than 50 years of age when diagnosed and by
              about 20\% (SE 4) for those of age 50-69 years when diagnosed,
              largely irrespective of the use of tamoxifen and of oestrogen
              receptor (ER) status, nodal status, or other tumour
              characteristics. Such regimens are significantly (2p=0.0001 for
              recurrence, 2p or =70 years), progesterone receptor status, or
              other tumour characteristics. 5 years is significantly
              (2p<0.00001 for recurrence, 2p=0.01 for breast cancer mortality)
              more effective than just 1-2 years of tamoxifen. For ER-positive
              tumours, the annual breast cancer mortality rates are similar
              during years 0-4 and 5-14, as are the proportional reductions in
              them by 5 years of tamoxifen, so the cumulative reduction in
              mortality is more than twice as big at 15 years as at 5 years
              after diagnosis. These results combine six meta-analyses:
              anthracycline-based versus no chemotherapy (8000 women);
              CMF-based versus no chemotherapy (14,000); anthracycline-based
              versus CMF-based chemotherapy (14,000); about 5 years of
              tamoxifen versus none (15,000); about 1-2 years of tamoxifen
              versus none (33,000); and about 5 years versus 1-2 years of
              tamoxifen (18,000). Finally, allocation to ovarian ablation or
              suppression (8000 women) also significantly reduces breast cancer
              mortality, but appears to do so only in the absence of other
              systemic treatments. For middle-aged women with ER-positive
              disease (the commonest type of breast cancer), the breast cancer
              mortality rate throughout the next 15 years would be
              approximately halved by 6 months of anthracycline-based
              chemotherapy (with a combination such as FAC or FEC) followed by
              5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. For, if mortality reductions of
              38\% (age <50 years) and 20\% (age 50-69 years) from such
              chemotherapy were followed by a further reduction of 31\% from
              tamoxifen in the risks that remain, the final mortality
              reductions would be 57\% and 45\%, respectively (and, the trial
              results could well have been somewhat stronger if there had been
              full compliance with the allocated treatments). Overall survival
              would be comparably improved, since these treatments have
              relatively small effects on mortality from the aggregate of all
              other causes. INTERPRETATION: Some of the widely practicable
              adjuvant drug treatments that were being tested in the 1980s,
              which substantially reduced 5-year recurrence rates (but had
              somewhat less effect on 5-year mortality rates), also
              substantially reduce 15-year mortality rates. Further
              improvements in long-term survival could well be available from
              newer drugs, or better use of older drugs.",

              20.3 months; P=0.01), and a 20 percent reduction in the risk of
              death. The most important adverse event was cardiac dysfunction
              of New York Heart Association class III or IV, which occurred in
              27 percent of the group given an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide,

              tumours early on-treatment. We used imaging mass cytometry3 to
              profile the in situ expression of 43 proteins in tumours from
              patients in a randomized trial of neoadjuvant ICB, sampled at
              three timepoints (baseline, n = 243; early on-treatment, n = 207;
              post-treatment, n = 210). Multivariate modelling showed that the
              fractions of proliferating CD8+TCF1+T cells and MHCII+ cancer
              cells were dominant predictors of response, followed by
              cancer-immune interactions with B cells and granzyme B+ T cells.
              On-treatment, responsive tumours contained abundant granzyme B+ T
              cells, whereas resistant tumours were characterized by CD15+
              cancer cells. Response was best predicted by combining tissue
              features before and on-treatment, pointing to a role for early
              biopsies in guiding adaptive therapy. Our findings show that
              multicellular spatial organization is a major determinant of ICB
              effect and suggest that its systematic enumeration in situ could
              help realize precision immuno-oncology.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Spatially resolved techniques for
              exploring the molecular landscape of tissue samples, such as
              spatial transcriptomics, often result in millions of data points
              and images too large to view on a regular desktop computer,
              limiting the possibilities in visual interactive data
              exploration. TissUUmaps is a free, open-source browser-based tool
              for GPU-accelerated visualization and interactive exploration of
              107+ data points overlaying tissue samples. METHODS: Herein we
              describe how TissUUmaps 3 provides instant multiresolution image
              viewing and can be customized, shared, and also integrated into
              Jupyter Notebooks. We introduce new modules where users can
              visualize markers and regions, explore spatial statistics,
              perform quantitative analyses of tissue morphology, and assess
              the quality of decoding in situ transcriptomics data. RESULTS: We
              show that thanks to targeted optimizations the time and cost
              associated with interactive data exploration were reduced,
              enabling TissUUmaps 3 to handle the scale of today's spatial
              transcriptomics methods. CONCLUSION: TissUUmaps 3 provides
              significantly improved performance for large multiplex datasets
              as compared to previous versions. We envision TissUUmaps to
              contribute to broader dissemination and flexible sharing of

                   application domains such as healthcare and robotics,
                   multimodal machine learning has brought unique computational
                   and theoretical challenges to the machine learning community
                   given the heterogeneity of data sources and the
                   interconnections often found between modalities. However,
                   the breadth of progress in multimodal research has made it
                   difficult to identify the common themes and open questions
                   in the field. By synthesizing a broad range of application
                   domains and theoretical frameworks from both historical and
                   recent perspectives, this paper is designed to provide an
                   overview of the computational and theoretical foundations of
                   multimodal machine learning. We start by defining three key
                   principles of modality heterogeneity, connections, and
                   interactions that have driven subsequent innovations, and
                   propose a taxonomy of six core technical challenges:
                   representation, alignment, reasoning, generation,
                   transference, and quantification covering historical and
                   recent trends. Recent technical achievements will be
                   presented through the lens of this taxonomy, allowing
                   researchers to understand the similarities and differences

              across multiple data modalities at unprecedented scale and

              situ hybridization, or single cell chromatin states are
              increasingly available across diverse tissue types. When

              for single-cell {RNA-sequencing}",
  author   = "Nelson, M E and Riva, S G and Cvejic, A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA-sequencing is revolutionising the
              study of cellular and tissue-wide heterogeneity in a large number
              of biological scenarios, from highly tissue-specific studies of
              disease to human-wide cell atlases. A central task in single-cell
              RNA-sequencing analysis design is the calculation of cell
              type-specific genes in order to study the differential impact of
              different replicates (e.g. tumour vs. non-tumour environment) on
              the regulation of those genes and their associated networks. The
              crucial task is the efficient and reliable calculation of such
              cell type-specific 'marker' genes. These optimise the ability of
              the experiment to isolate highly-specific cell phenotypes of
              interest to the analyser. However, while methods exist that can
              calculate marker genes from single-cell RNA-sequencing, no such
              method places emphasise on specific cell phenotypes for
              downstream study in e.g. differential gene expression or other
              experimental protocols (spatial transcriptomics protocols for
              example). Here we present SMaSH, a general computational
              framework for extracting key marker genes from single-cell
              RNA-sequencing data which reliably characterise highly-specific
              and niche populations of cells in numerous different biological
              data-sets. RESULTS: SMaSH extracts robust and biologically
              well-motivated marker genes, which characterise a given
              single-cell RNA-sequencing data-set better than existing
              computational approaches for general marker gene calculation. We
              demonstrate the utility of SMaSH through its substantial
              performance improvement over several existing methods in the
              field. Furthermore, we evaluate the SMaSH markers on spatial
              transcriptomics data, demonstrating they identify highly
              localised compartments of the mouse cortex. CONCLUSION: SMaSH is
              a new methodology for calculating robust markers genes from large
              single-cell RNA-sequencing data-sets, and has implications for
              e.g. effective gene identification for probe design in downstream
              analyses spatial transcriptomics experiments. SMaSH has been
              fully-integrated with the ScanPy framework and provides a
              valuable bioinformatics tool for cell type characterisation and
              validation in every-growing data-sets spanning over 50 different
              cell types across hundreds of thousands of cells.",

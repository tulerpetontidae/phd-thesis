              STAR-FISH (specific-to-allele PCR-FISH), a novel method for the
              combined detection of single-nucleotide and copy number
              alterations in single cells in intact archived tissues. Using
              this method, we assessed the clinical impact of changes in the

              not always present in the same cells. Chemotherapy selects for
              PIK3CA-mutant cells, a minor subpopulation in nearly all
              treatment-naive samples, and modulates genetic diversity within
              tumors. Treatment-associated changes in the spatial distribution

              intratumor heterogeneity, without any obvious morphological and
              pathological steps to define sequential evolution, and its
              progression may vary among individual tumors. In an attempt to
              elucidate these etiological and phenotypic complexities, the
              present study, based on the fundamental concept that genomic
              instability is the engine of both tumor progression and tumor
              heterogeneity, was conducted to test the hypothesis that breast
              cancer pathogenesis is driven by double-strand break
              (DSB)-initiated chromosome instability (CIN). The rationale
              underlying this hypothesis is derived from the clues provided by
              family breast cancer syndromes, in which susceptibility genes,
              including p53, ATM, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are involved within the
              common functional pathway of DSB-related checkpoint/ repair.
              Because genomic deletion caused by DSB is reflected in the
              genetic mechanism of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), this
              genome-wide LOH study was conducted, using 100 tumors and 400
              microsatellite markers. To minimize the effect of heterogeneity
              within tumors, the experimental technique of laser capture
              microdissection was used to ensure that genetic and phenotypic
              examinations were based on the same tumor cells. Support for our
              hypothesis comes from the observations that: (a) the extent of
              DSB-initiated CIN in tumors significantly increased as tumors
              progressed to poorer grades or later stages; (b) in the
              sequential steps toward CIN, the loci of p53 and ATM, the key
              checkpoint genes against DSB, were lost at the earliest stage;
              and (c) many loci identified to be important in breast
              tumorigenesis were the genomic sites possibly harboring the genes
              involved in DSB-related checkpoint/repair (including RAD51,
              RAD52, and BRCA1) or CIN (including FA-A, FA-D, and WRN), and a
              higher number of these loci showing LOH was significantly
              associated with increased level of DSB-initiated CIN (P <
              0.0001). Breast cancers are thus considered to be sequentially
              progressive with CIN. However, CIN might also cause genetic
              heterogeneity, which was revealed by the findings that LOH at
              some markers was observed only in the component of ductal
              carcinoma in situ but not in the invasive component of the same
              tumors. In addition, some markers were found to preferentially
              lose at specific tumor grades, implying their contribution to
              genetic heterogeneity during tumor development. Therefore, this
              study suggests that breast cancer progression is clonal with
              regard to CIN, but different breast cancers would present
              distinct molecular profiles resulting from genetic heterogeneity
              caused by CIN.",

              (NSCLC), data on intratumor heterogeneity and cancer genome
              evolution have been limited to small retrospective cohorts. We
              wanted to prospectively investigate intratumor heterogeneity in
              relation to clinical outcome and to determine the clonal nature
              of driver events and evolutionary processes in early-stage NSCLC.
              METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we performed
              multiregion whole-exome sequencing on 100 early-stage NSCLC
              tumors that had been resected before systemic therapy. We
              sequenced and analyzed 327 tumor regions to define evolutionary
              histories, obtain a census of clonal and subclonal events, and
              assess the relationship between intratumor heterogeneity and
              recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: We observed widespread
              intratumor heterogeneity for both somatic copy-number alterations
              and mutations. Driver mutations in EGFR, MET, BRAF, and TP53 were
              almost always clonal. However, heterogeneous driver alterations
              that occurred later in evolution were found in more than 75\% of
              the tumors and were common in PIK3CA and NF1 and in genes that
              are involved in chromatin modification and DNA damage response
              and repair. Genome doubling and ongoing dynamic chromosomal

              resulted in parallel evolution of driver somatic copy-number
              alterations, including amplifications in CDK4, FOXA1, and BCL11A.
              Elevated copy-number heterogeneity was associated with an
              increased risk of recurrence or death (hazard ratio, 4.9;
              P=4.4$\times$10-4), which remained significant in multivariate

              recurrence or death, a finding that supports the potential value
              of chromosome instability as a prognostic predictor. (Funded by

              relies on homogenized tissue samples. Due to the high degree of
              cellular and molecular heterogeneity of tumor tissues, bulk
              tissue-based analytical approaches can only provide very limited
              system-level information about different signaling mechanisms and
              cellular interactions within the complex tissue context. METHODS:
              We describe an analytical approach using in situ sequencing
              (ISS), enabling highly multiplexed, spatially and morphologically
              resolved gene expression profiling. Ninety-one genes including
              prognostic and predictive marker profiles, as well as genes
              involved in specific cellular pathways were mapped within whole
              breast cancer tissue sections, covering luminal A/B-like,
              HER2-positive and triple negative tumors. Finally, all these
              features were combined and assembled into a
              molecular-morphological OncoMap for each tumor tissue. FINDINGS:
              Our in situ approach spatially revealed intratumoral
              heterogeneity with regard to tumor subtype as well as to the
              OncotypeDX recurrence score and even uncovered areas of minor
              cellular subpopulations. Since ISS-resolved molecular profiles
              are linked to their histological context, a deeper analysis of
              the core and periphery of tumor foci enabled identification of
              specific gene expression patterns associated with these
              morphologically relevant regions. INTERPRETATION: ISS generated
              OncoMaps represent useful tools to extend our general

              systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of
              edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a
              lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy
              function in the physical system determines its Gibbs
              distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random
              field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF
              image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural
              mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local
              characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation
              mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and
              multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is
              an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy,
              the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical
              system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system
              isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same
              thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The
              analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the
              maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the
              degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel
              ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish

               approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This
               problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which
               frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation
               involving the posterior density. In this article, we review
               variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that
               approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has
               been used in many applications and tends to be faster than
               classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.
               The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and
               then to find a member of that family which is close to the
               target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback?Leibler
               divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational
               inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential
               family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of
               Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic
               optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern
               research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is
               powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing

                   simple model, fits it to her data, refines it according to

                   to large data is a bottleneck in this process. Deriving
                   algorithms for new models can be both mathematically and
                   computationally challenging, which makes it difficult to
                   efficiently cycle through the steps. To this end, we develop
                   automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI).
                   Using our method, the scientist only provides a
                   probabilistic model and a dataset, nothing else. ADVI

                   2008, multiple frameworks have been built on top of it and
                   it has been used to produce many state-of-the-art machine
                   learning models. The present article is structured as
                   follows. Section I provides an overview of the Theano
                   software and its community. Section II presents the
                   principal features of Theano and how to use them, and
                   compares them with other similar projects. Section III
                   focuses on recently-introduced functionalities and
                   improvements. Section IV compares the performance of Theano
                   against Torch7 and TensorFlow on several machine learning
                   models. Section V discusses current limitations of Theano
                   and potential ways of improving it.",

  abstract  = "Probabilistic programming allows for automatic Bayesian
               inference on user-defined probabilistic models. Recent advances
               in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on
               increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as
               Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is
               often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source
               probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses
               Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as
               well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for
               increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming
               languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python
               code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great
               flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is
               a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.",

                   Probabilistic Programming in {NumPyro}",
  author        = "Phan, Du and Pradhan, Neeraj and Jankowiak, Martin",
  abstract      = "NumPyro is a lightweight library that provides an alternate
                   NumPy backend to the Pyro probabilistic programming language
                   with the same modeling interface, language primitives and
                   effect handling abstractions. Effect handlers allow Pyro's
                   modeling API to be extended to NumPyro despite its being
                   built atop a fundamentally different JAX-based functional
                   backend. In this work, we demonstrate the power of composing
                   Pyro's effect handlers with the program transformations that
                   enable hardware acceleration, automatic differentiation, and
                   vectorization in JAX. In particular, NumPyro provides an
                   iterative formulation of the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) that
                   can be end-to-end JIT compiled, yielding an implementation
                   that is much faster than existing alternatives in both the
                   small and large dataset regimes.",
